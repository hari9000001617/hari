"},{"id":46,"title":"Accounting Calendars, Years, and Periods","url":"11336.htm","text":"Multiple accounting calendars can be defined in Singleview.  An accounting calendar groups one or more accounting years.   In a Singleview implementation that requires multiple overlapping accounting years or periods. The overlapping years or periods must belong to different accounting calendars. That is, no accounting year or period belonging to the same accounting calendar can overlap.  A reporting entity references an accounting calendar to determine the accounting period to use for financial reporting.  An accounting period is a period of time for which a set of financial statements is generated.  Within an accounting year, the length of the accounting period is arbitrary and fixed, based on the reporting requirements of the company (for example, day, week, month, quarter, or year).  Accounting years and accounting periods in Convergent Billing must reflect the financial years and accounting periods of the service provider; however, this restriction is not enforced by Convergent Billing.  Accounting years in Convergent Billing are normally broken down into smaller accounting periods.  Start and end dates for accounting years and periods are flexible; therefore, Convergent Billing supports any type of accounting period.  Examples are:  Calendar months  Calendar quarters  Twelve periods following a 4-4-5 week profile, ending on any day of the week (that is, a four week period, followed by a four week period, followed by a five week period).   Thirteen periods of four weeks.   Accounting periods are used by Convergent Billing during the:  Rating process, to group the effects of rating charges on GL codes.  GL upload process, to report the accounting period in which a set of uploaded transactions were posted to the Sales Journal.  Accounting years and periods support date and date-time granularity.  Although accounting years and periods have a duration, neither entity has history records (that is, date ranging is not supported and modifications are made directly on the entity).  Accounting years and periods have a status of Open or Closed.  After a period is closed, journal entries cannot be added to the period; the journal entries are reflected in the current period.  An accounting year is automatically closed if all of its accounting periods are closed.  More than one accounting period can be open at any one time, in which case a journal entry is posted to the period to which it logically belongs.

Secondary accounts are set up by clicking the Other Accounts... button on the Customer Detail form.  Examples of secondary accounts include:   Deposit accounts, for recording customer deposits.  Loyalty accounts, for recording loyalty or frequent user points.  Each account has an account type that defines the different types of accounts to which charges are applied.

"},{"id":52,"title":"Adjustments","url":"1924.htm","text":"In Convergent Billing, any transaction outside of the normal billing cycle transactions (namely, invoices and payments) that affects the outstanding balance of an account, is referred to as an adjustment.  For example, an adjustment may be required to refund a client for a service not disconnected at the correct time.  An adjustment can be allocated (either fully or partially) to a specific invoice, split and allocated to multiple invoices, or simply credited (or debited) to a customer&#8217;s account.  Adjustments can be classified into a number of different adjustment types.  For example, they can be classified as adjustments relating to billing errors, service calls, or goodwill credits.  To ensure that limits are imposed on the amounts and currencies in which adjustments can be entered, each user is given a predefined adjustment limit.  The predefined limit determines the maximum amount of any adjustment entered by that user.  A user is further restricted in that they are only permitted to enter adjustments in a single, predefined currency.  Adjustments can be entered in either of the following ways:  Individually  In batches of the same adjustment type.  See Adjustment Batches.  The system assigns an adjustment number to every recorded adjustment irrespective of whether that adjustment was entered as an individual adjustment or entered as part of an adjustment batch.  In addition, each adjustment batch is assigned an adjustment batch number by which it can be referenced.  Set of individual adjustments of the same type processed at the same time.  Each adjustment within the batch can be viewed or modified until the batch is applied (processed).  An adjustment batch can be created incrementally (one or more adjustments at a time) over a period of time.  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Adjustment.  The adjustment type determines the format of each adjustment number and adjustment batch number.  The format for an adjustment number usually includes a unique prefix so that, when viewing a customer&#8217;s account details, adjustments of a specific type can be more readily identified in the list of transactions.  If errors are discovered in an adjustment when that adjustment is posted for example, the adjustment was incorrectly allocated), facilities are provided to:  Change the allocation of the adjustment to an invoice.  Reverse the adjustment.  Delete the adjustment.  Facilities are provided in the system to search for and view specific adjustments and specific adjustment batches.  "},{"id":53,"title":"Anonymous Arrays","url":"1645.htm","text":"Anonymous arrays are arrays without a name.  The syntax of anonymous arrays is defined as follows:  [ <expression>, <expression>, ... ]  The type of the expressions the array contains (providing the expressions are all the same type) defines the type of an anonymous array.  If the expressions are not of the same type, the type of anonymous array is Unknown.  An empty anonymous Array can be of any type required (as the type is dependent on where it is used).  An anonymous array can itself contain anonymous arrays, or expressions returning hashes.  If all elements in an anonymous Array are constants, the array is constructed at parse time (rather than runtime) for improved performance.  For example:  var FieldNames$[];  FieldNames$[] := ['SERVICE_ID', 'SERVICE_NAME',                    'GENERAL_1', 'GENERAL_2'];  Anonymous arrays support the concept of array slices in Convergent Billing.    "},{"id":54,"title":"Archiving","url":"4495.htm","text":"The terms 'archiving' and 'un-archiving' imply the exporting or importing of data relating to specific database entities, taken from one or more tables in the database.  For example, the entity customer contains information about the individual customer, the customer hierarchy, the people nominated as contacts, the accounts involved, invoice details, and much more.    An entity is made up of the base level data (for example, customer details) plus all dependent data, wherever it is stored in the database.  Archiving is not synonymous with backup and restore, which are generally carried out on one or more complete tables (if not the entire database), and are used to provide a means of recovering from any damage the database may suffer as a result of hardware or software failure.    Archiving is more generally used to remove and archive database entities no longer required; for example, customers who have permanently closed their accounts, people who have moved away, or products no longer available.  As data of this kind is archived, it can also be automatically purged from the database.  Another common use for archiving is the transfer of entity data, spanning several tables, from one database to another.  For example, a subset of data from an operational database might be archived, then imported into a training database, to provide realistic dummy data for students to work on.  In this case, the original data would not be purged after archiving.  The archiving feature can be used to purge unwanted data from the database, such as dummy data entered by students in a training database when their training is complete and the data is no longer required.  Purging is done by using the archiving feature with no output file specified and the purge option turned on.  Data purged in this way is lost forever, so the technique should only be used on unwanted data.  The archiving feature is not designed to archive large volumes of configuration or operational data.  For example, the archiving feature should not be used to archive or remove a large set of subscribers from a production system.  Not only does archiving or purging large volumes of data take considerable time, but it is likely that system performance is significantly degraded during the archiving period.    In some systems, even archiving the operational data associated with a single customer may not be advisable.  For example, a customer with a high volume service (such as a government body) may have millions of entries in the normalised event table.  Charge and normalised event tables contain the highest volume of data in the system and the period to archive the customer node and its associated data may be lengthy.   Archiving can be carried out from the client workstation by scheduling a task, or from the UNIX command line.  All options available from the command line are also available through the scheduler.  In either case, the key parameter that the archiver needs is an Archive type, which specifies all the tables and dependencies that make up the entity being archived.  Archive types are provided with the base installation, and cannot be defined or changed by users.  Convergent Billing archiving uses either the Oracle imp and exp utilities, or sqlimport and sqlexport if the archive files are required in ASCII format.

That is, if placed before a variable, they increment or decrement the variable before returning the value, and if placed after the variable, increment or decrement the variable after returning the value.   Notes on the Equivalence Operator  The equivalence operator makes the local variable on the left-hand side of the operator equivalent to the expression on the right-hand side.  Subsequent accesses or assignments to the local variable are equivalent to accessing or assigning to the expression on the right-hand side.  The following restrictions apply to the reference operator:  The left-hand side must be a local variable.  The right-hand side must be an expression that returns a variable reference.  The data types of the left-hand and right-hand sides must match exactly.  An object referenced by an equivalence operator must never be undefined.  After undefining an array or hash containing an element that is referenced, using the reference to update the element's value gives an indeterminate result.  Arithmetic Operators for Composite Types  Operator  Array  Hash  +, +=  Concatenation  Join  It is important to be aware of the details of the 'join' operation carried out when hashes are aggregated using the + and += operators.  When two hashes are aggregated within a subtotal, the following algorithm applies:  If the hashes both contain a specific key, the values from the two hashes for the key are added to form the value for that key in the result hash.  If only one of the hashes contains a specific key, the value for the key in the original hash becomes the value for that key in the result hash.  When two hashes are aggregated within an expression, the following algorithm applies:  If the hashes both contain a specific key, the value from the second hash (the hash on the right side of the operator) becomes the value for that key in the result.  If only one of the hashes contains a specific key, the value for the key in the original hash becomes the value for that key in the result.  "},{"id":56,"title":"Array Slices","url":"1647.htm","text":"Array slices are supported in a named array.  For example:  <array name><scalar type>[<expr1> .. <expr2>]  An array slice returns an array of the elements in <array name> from the element identified by <expr1> to the element identified by <expr2> inclusive.  If the value of <expr1> is greater than the value of <expr2>, the order of the elements in the result array is reversed.  Array slices are not assignable, they cannot appear on the left-hand side of the assignment operator (:=), and cannot be passed by reference to a function.  If <array name> is of unknown type, providing that all elements in the slice are of the same type, an array slice can be successfully cast to a different type (the type checking is performed at runtime).  "},{"id":57,"title":"Arrays","url":"1643.htm","text":"Arrays can be defined in Convergent Billing as local variables in expression blocks and functions, subject to the following conditions:  Arrays are defined using the following syntax:    <array name><scalar type>[]  The <scalar type> defines the data type of each element in the array.  For example, var charges#[] defines an array of real data type.  Array elements are referenced using the following syntax:  <array name><scalar type>[<expression>]  The <expression> must evaluate to an integer.  For example, charges# [1] := '5.25' assigns the value '5.25' to the second element of the array (the first element is charges# [0]).  The following table lists examples of array usage.  Example  Description  a$[10]  Accesses the array element.  a$[]  Accesses the array as a whole.  var b?[];b$[0][] := a$[];  Assigns an array to an array element.  b$ [0][0] := 'expression';  Assigns an element in a two-dimensional array.  var b?[];b$[0]{} := a${};  Assigns a hash to an array element.  b$[0]{'First'} := 'FirstValue';  Assigns an element of a hash within an array.  Array variables expand dynamically to accommodate new elements, limited only by available memory.  Only arrays with the 'unknown' scalar type support nested arrays and hashes.  Nested arrays and hashes are implicitly created as they are referenced.  There is no limit to the depth at which arrays or hashes can be nested.  An array cannot be declared with multiple dimensions.  For example, the following is incorrect:  var a?[ ][ ];  To create a multi-dimensional array, a single-dimensional array of unknown type must first be declared, and then the nested arrays (or hashes) are accessed as required.  An array variable is uniquely identified by its name only, as opposed to scalar variables, which are uniquely identified by name and type.  For example, the following is incorrect:  var a&[ ], a$[ ];  The variable a has already been declared to be of type integer array, and cannot be declared to be of type string array in the same scope.  Arrays, hashes, and scalar variables have their own namespaces.  For example, var a&[ ],a${ }, a$, a&, a#, a~, is sound, but to avoid confusion it is not recommended.  To access or assign a value as a specific type in an unknown array, use the appropriate data type suffix; for example:  var a?[];<br>a$[0] := 'Sample String';<br>#Assign string value to first element of a?[]  a$[0] is not equivalent to to_string(a?[0]).  The expression a$[0] results in a runtime error if the value stored in the first element of the a?[] is not a string, whereas to_string(a?[0]) converts the value to a string (using default formats for integers, reals, and dates) if it is not already a string.   In general, the value accessed must be of the type specified, or a runtime error occurs, although casting between integer and real values is permitted.  However, accessing a real value as an integer changes the value stored in the element to an integer, and accessing a integer as a real value changes the value stored in the element to a real value; for example:  var a?[];<br>a#[0] := 1.1;<br>if (a&[0] > 0) then # Implicit casting to Integer<br>print(a#[0]); # This prints 1, NOT 1.1  Data types in an anonymous array determine the data type of the array.  If the data types are not all the same, the data type of the anonymous array is unknown.

For users of Singleview Convergent Billing, an attribute type defines the format, characteristics, and validation rules for a form field.   For external systems, attribute types control representation of an entity's data model.  In this context, attribute types can define:   Fields that uniquely identify an entity instance  Labels that can be used to access fields of an entity  A field's value as a reference to another Convergent Billing entity  A non-stored attribute that is derived from an entity's stored fields.   Attribute types are defined independently of the data entry fields to which they relate, so the same attribute type to be used for multiple fields.  Attribute type configuration can be used to add security to a field using any of the following features:  Adding encryption  Adding data masking   Restricting view and update access for specific security groups  Enabling or disabling access for specific security groups.  In conjunction with reference types, attribute types allow generic Convergent Billing fields to be customised using entity validation.  Customising fields includes adding new fields.  The customer care forms include a General tab, which contains invisible general fields that can be customised to become visible.  To speed up data entry and reduce the scope and level of validation required, a reference type can be specified in an attribute type so the user can select one of a number of pre-defined values rather than having to determine, and then enter, an appropriate value in the correct format.

"},{"id":67,"title":"Bill Runs","url":"2052.htm","text":"In Convergent Billing, bill run types are used to configure what tasks run together for a specific bill run.  Bill run types offer the option of running a range of billing operations, from adjusting rental events to un-applying invoices.  Generating rental events (RGP), generating invoices (BGP) and invoice images (IGP), and outputting those results (GOP) are all possible tasks for a bill run.  For example, a standard bill run schedule could be configured to perform an immediate bill run consisting of the BGP, IGP, and to apply invoices, but not to run the RGP or the GOP.  If required, the apply invoices and revoke invoices processes can also be run as individual schedules.  For example, if a daily cycle bill run fails and it is determined that one customer caused the failure, the whole bill run does not have to be revoked and rerun; only the customer who caused the failure needs to be revoked and rerun.  Using bill runs, it is possible to generate invoices, which are sent out to the customer for payment, and temporary statements, which can be used for quality assurance purposes or for customer information.  Invoices can also be generated for designated interim rental events (tariffs), so a customer can be invoiced for a specific product or service (using the Interim Bill Run schedule type).  Processing multiple customer nodes speeds up the bill run process, and controls the quality of the process.  For example, the user can review initial invoices before the majority of customer nodes have been processed; if the first invoices contain errors, the bill run can be stopped.  Statistical information for each billing operation is recorded, including the success or failure of the operation and its duration.  For bill runs processing multiple customers, the statistical information is recorded for each operation and summarised for the overall bill run.  Billing personnel also have complete control over how many errors can occur before the bill run is aborted.

Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).  "},{"id":74,"title":"Default Charge Categories","url":"1850.htm","text":"When working with charge categories, it is important to distinguish between the charge category instance, defined with the product instance, and the default charge categories, which are used to provide default values when the instance is created.  The charge category instance is defined automatically when the product instance is defined, using values from the default charge category specified in the tariff definition.  If necessary, these values can be overridden at the customer node, or by modified default charge categories specified in the customer type or the service type.  Changing values in this way gives provides much flexibility in deciding which account is to be used for a specific event.  Examples of the use of these defaults are provided separately.  Default charge category definitions do not, in general, define an account number, because the account to use is often not known until the charge category instance is defined.  At that time, the appropriate account number is determined, based on the account type defined in the charge category default.  For example, a charge or benefit should be posted to the primary account belonging to the customer node.  To achieve this, the account type in the charge category default must be the same as the account type of the primary account.  However, it may sometimes be necessary to define a specific account number in a default charge category.

Example 3  Splitting a Charge between Customer Nodes  Requirement  Two customer nodes share a service defined at one of the nodes.  The other customer node agrees to pay 30% of the charges for the service.  Solution  Define a duplicate of the charge category instance, with the account number set to the primary account of the other node, and the proportion set to 0.3 (the proportion this node will pay).  Amend the existing charge category instance, by changing the proportion to 0.7 (the proportion paid by this customer node).  When charges are split in this way, the sum of all the proportions defined must be 1.  Example 4  Using a different Account Type  Requirement  The company awards loyalty points based on usage.

Zero is returned if the values being compared are the same.  A positive integer is returned if the first value is greater than the second.  A negative integer is returned if the first value is less than the second.  Notes on Array and Hash Operations  Arrays are compared by examining corresponding elements, or by comparing with an undefined value if there is no corresponding element in one of the arrays.  An undefined value is compared after all other values, which is consistent with the ordering of NULL values by Oracle.  An undefined value is not equivalent to the default value for an undefined element.  A runtime error is raised if Array elements cannot be ordered.  For example, an integer cannot be compared to a string, and a string cannot be compared to a hash.  A runtime error is also raised if a comparison is made between unequal hash elements.  Arrays are equal if they are the same size, and each element is equal with the corresponding element in the second Array.  Two hashes are equal if they are the same size, they have the same set of keys, and the corresponding key values in each hash are equal.

Convergent Billing offers support for rapidly configuring new products and tariffs to meet customers&#8217; changing requirements.  Configuring products involves a combination of service types, equipment types, tariffs, subtotals, facility groups, derived attributes, and product offers. The combination of these elements provides the flexibility required to deliver a product offering tailored to specific customer requirements.  Convergent Billing is also designed to meet the growing demands for a more personalised service.  The customer care environment allows users to respond to new and existing customers promptly, consistently, and professionally.  However, the system also provides the capability of customising the customer care forms to perform functions to manage specific business requirements.  Administrators of the system therefore have control over the information captured by users.    Configuring the customer care environment involves a combination of reference types, attribute types, help entry definitions, entity validation, address formats, and customer care types.  In addition, comprehensive security features enable the control of access to information and the use of the system.  Configuring security settings involves a combination of security groups, form roles, function roles, work groups, profiles, and user definitions.  To manage the extensive configuration options available, the system provides the capability of viewing the entire configuration in an environment similar to Windows Explorer or FrontPage Explorer.  The Configuration Explorer (see the Configuration Fundamentals Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing) enables the viewing of the contents of a configuration object, all the references to the object, and the properties of the object.  Viewing the configuration of the system from a central area enables administrators to:  Investigate the effects of changes to the configuration.

One of the main reasons for recording a contact is to assign that contact to a customer, which can be regarded as simply creating a 'link' between that contact and a specified customer.  The link effectively defines a relationship between contact and customer.  If the link is no longer required, the link can be removed by unassigning the contact.  The same contact can be assigned to more than one customer.  Each assignment is independent of each of the other assignments.  Unassigning a contact therefore has no effect on the links to any other customer.  Unassigning a contact simply removes the link between the contact and a specified customer and is therefore not the same as deleting the contact  A contact can be assigned as a primary customer contact (typically the person to whom the customer&#8217;s invoice is sent) or as a secondary customer contact.  To ensure integrity of customer data, the system only permits a primary customer contact to be replaced or modified.  A contact assigned as a primary customer contact can therefore only be deleted after it is replaced (if it is not specified as a primary customer contact for another customer).  A contact assigned as a secondary customer contact can be unassigned, replaced, modified, or deleted whenever required.  Details for a contact can be maintained whenever required.

For example, if an account is required for each division in a multi-national company, a separate customer node is used to represent each division&#8217;s account.  The customer nodes in the customer hierarchy are organised into a structure (very often mirroring the company&#8217;s organisational structure) that is similar to a family tree.  Like a family tree, a customer hierarchy displays the relationship between customer nodes.  A relationship exists between Node A and the two nodes directly below it, namely Nodes B and C.  In terms of the hierarchy, Node A is said to be the parent of Nodes B and C.  Nodes B and C are said to be children of Node A.  A similar parent-child relationship exists between Node B and Nodes D and E, and between Node C and Nodes F and G.  Notice that Node B is both a child (of Node A) and a parent (of Nodes D and E).  Similarly, Node C is both a child (of Node A) and a parent (of Nodes F and G).  The node at the top of the customer hierarchy is unique in that it has no parent node.  It is considered as the root of the hierarchy and is referred to as the root customer node.  Associated with each customer node within the hierarchy is a reporting level, which determines whether that node is to receive an invoice, statement, or neither.

For the complete definition of ASN.1, refer to the ITU-T Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) X.208 Fascicle VII.4.  Though primarily intended for parsing event data, the DIL is not limited to this sole function.  The DIL can be used, for example, to process payment records, calling TRE remote functions to insert the payment details into the database.  The DIL is used to decode a sequence of bytes that make up one or more event records, breaking each record up into its constituent fields.  Where necessary, these fields can be manipulated, using the Convergent Billing Expression Parser Module (EPM), and eventually converted to the Direct Variables that make up a Normalised Event.  The resulting event can then be rated, to generate charges for the appropriate service.  A DIL definition is made up of keywords, type definitions,\tidentifiers, semantics, and included definitions.

In addition, however, a derived attribute possesses two further attributes: the Result Value Attribute Type and the Evaluation Type.  Specifies the mechanism used to derive the value returned by a derived attribute.  The value of the attribute is derived by evaluating one or more expressions, or by looking up the value in a predefined table of values.  If no value is derived, the value of a predefined default expression is used.  One of the following evaluation types can be specified:  Conditional:  Single Value Returned  Conditional:  Multiple Values Returned  List  Simple Expression  Table Lookup by Best Match  Table Lookup by Multiple (1-10) Keys  Table Lookup by Searching  Table Lookup by Single Range.

List  Derived attribute, with an evaluation type of List, can be used as a component of a product definition, customer type, or service type that defines the type of information to be held in an associated list.  The list defines a set of values that identify items having similar properties or uses (for example, frequently called numbers).  The values stored in the list are added in response to information obtained from the customer.  Generally this type of derived attribute is defined for special tariffs to be applied if one or more of the list items are matched during the rating process.  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Derived Attribute and Evaluation Type.  Simple Expression  Evaluation type used to derive the value of a derived attribute.  Returns the value of a single expression; no other evaluation is performed.  Typically, this evaluation type is used to define a derived attribute from a direct variable.

Table Lookup by Best Match allows up to ten indexes to be defined as the keys into the look-up table.  Any result value returned must match all of the indexes specified.    Table Lookup by Best Match compares the index expression with each predefined index value held in a table of values (known as a look-up table).

"},{"id":118,"title":"Direct Variables","url":"1698.htm","text":"A direct variable is a variable mapped to data held in a database table or to a column in a database view.  The value of the variable is determined by the context in which the variable is used. For example, each field of a normalised event record is mapped to a direct variable.  During normalisation of event data, each data field of a normalised event record is stored as a direct variable.  The variables into which the field values are mapped are defined specifically for the type of record being normalised.  Product Administrators do not need to know what these mappings are, but to know what direct variables are available.  For example, to define a usage tariff, call data information (for example, calling party ID, called party ID, and call duration) needs to be referenced.  Data information is stored in direct variables (for example, APartyId$, BPartyId$, and Duration#) when a call data record is normalised and is therefore available directly.  Direct variables therefore allow a field in a database record to be referenced, and the referenced value used in expressions.  Direct variables can also be used as the basis for other variable types.  If required, additional direct variables can be defined, which requires knowledge of SQL and the names and structure of the Convergent Billing database tables.  Like other variables, direct variables can be referenced in tariffs and subtotals by including the name of the variable.  Direct variables are always defined with an application environment of Data Entry.  Direct variables created during normalisation should usually cover most requirements.

For example, if a customer has a companion product that provides 60 minutes of free call-time per month, and the first call made that month is a 70 minute call, they are only charged for the last 10 minutes, because the free minutes are consumed first.

Entity validation provides control over what information is captured by a user, and how it is captured. This is achieved by adding and removing fields from generic Convergent Billing forms, customising generic Convergent Billing fields, and adding field security, field validation, intelligent defaulting, and context-sensitive help.  Entity validation can tailor an entity's data model for integration with external systems. Non-stored attributes that are derived from an entity's stored attributes can be added, external aliases for attributes can be assigned, and the sets of key attributes that identify an entity instance can be configured.   Reference types, attribute types, and key field functions are components for entity validation. Customising a field using entity validation involves associating an attribute type with that field. Configuring the keys that identify an entity instance requires specification of new key field functions.  Customising fields includes adding new fields.  The customer care forms include a General tab, which contains invisible general fields that can be customised to become visible.  The attribute type defines many of the changes to the field such as whether it is based on a reference type, its format, characteristics, hint text, context-sensitive help, field security, field external alias, field validation, and field defaults (more extensive validation and field defaults can be set up within entity validation). The attribute also specifies the addition and defines the derivation of non-stored attributes.  After associating an attribute type with a field, the field can be customised further by entity validation. Fields can also be defined to change their characteristics or default values based on a value entered in a separate field.

An additional field, used to enter further information, is displayed.    The characteristics of another field are inappropriate for the option selected, so the characteristics of the field are automatically modified.  The Control Next feature does not work on grids, except for derived attribute grids where child reference types are used.    Changing the configuration of fields based on the data entered in a separate field is achieved by allowing the attribute type assigned to one field to control the attribute type assigned to another field.    If the Control Next field (in an entity validation definition row) is set to Yes, the attribute type in that row has control over the attribute type in the row directly below it.  Depending on how the attribute types are set up, the Control Next feature can have the following effects:  If the controlling attribute type is based on a reference type that has a child attribute type associated with one of its reference items, that child attribute type overrides the attribute type in the next row when that reference item is selected.    The result is that the second field changes its configuration when an option is selected from the first field.  To display a new field on the form when an option is selected, an attribute type defining an invisible (or null) field must be defined.  The attribute type defining the blank field is then overridden and the new field is displayed.  If the controlling attribute is based on a reference type that has a child reference type associated with one of its reference items, that child reference type overrides any reference type specified in the attribute type in the next row when that reference item is selected.    The result is that the second field changes its reference list (drop-down list) when an option is selected in the first field.  Child reference types are supported only in derived attribute grids; they are not supported in other grids with entity validation.    For example, they are supported in the Derived Attribute Table form, Customer Lists, and Service Lists; they are not supported in the Payment Batch form, Adjustment Batch form, Customer Invoice Format form, and Customer Contacts form.  If the field being controlled has a default expression defined, that expression is evaluated when the field associated with the first attribute type is modified.

The application environment for this call must therefore be Rating, and the context must be Normalised Event.  The call to the ceil() EPM built-in function is required because the function is defined with the Period& parameter of type Integer.  A function call requires the statement of the function name, followed by any parameters in brackets.  The name and data type of the function must be compatible with those in the function definition, and the data types of any parameters passed must be compatible with those of the formal parameters in the function definition.  The number of parameters passed must match the number of parameters defined for the function.  For each corresponding parameter:  If the parameter is defined to be passed-by-reference (var prefix), the passed parameter must be a variable or non-constant function parameter of the same data type as the defined parameter.  If the parameter is defined to be passed-by-value (no prefix) or a constant (const prefix), the following applies:  The passed parameter must be an expression returning the same data type as the defined parameter.  If the defined parameter is defined to be of a real data type, the passed parameter can be an expression returning an integer value.  If the defined parameter is defined to be of type unknown (? suffix), the passed parameter must be an expression returning any scalar type.  If the defined parameter is defined to be of type unknown array (?[] suffix), the passed parameter must be an expression returning any array type.  If the defined parameter is defined to be of type unknown hash (?{} suffix), the passed parameter must be an expression returning any hash type.  Calling functions in a way that violates these guidelines is not supported.  Using parameters incorrectly can result in arbitrary or undefined behaviour; for example, the program may stop, exit, or produce unexpected or meaningless results.  To ensure that parameters behave correctly:  Pass parameters by reference, value, and constant as follows:  pass-by-reference parameters (var prefix) when the function modifies the parameter and the modified value is required by the function caller.    Pass-by-value (no parameter prefix) when the function modifies the value but the modified value is not required by the function caller.  Pass-by-constant (const prefix) when the function does not modify the parameter value.  Do not pass a hash or array by reference, and elements from the hash or array by reference or constant into the same function call.  For example, the FuncUpdate&(var Details?{}, var ServiceName$, var FunctName$) function called as follows could result in arbitrary or undefined behaviour:  {      var lData?{};      .      .      .      FuncUpdate&(lData?{}, lData${'SERVICE'}, lData${'FUNCTION'})  }  If a variable is set to an element of an array or hash using the equivalence operator (::=), the array or hash values must not be cleared, undefined, or reassigned while the variable is still in scope.  For example:  var x?[] := ['Text', 'Goobaa', ['a', 'b', 'c'], 10];  var a?{} := ['a', 1, 'b', 2, 'c', 3, 'rows', 4];  a?{'rows'}[] := x?[];  var b?[] ::= a?{'rows'}[2][];  undefine(a?{'rows'});  # Array referenced by b?[] has been freed.  # The following assignment causes a runtime error or undefined behaviour:  b?[2] := 's';  "},{"id":156,"title":"Function Overloading","url":"1651.htm","text":"Singleview supports the overloading of user-defined and registered functions.  A function is overloaded if the same function name and return type are used by more than one function.  Functions with the same name and return type can have different interface numbers, if the EPM parsing engine can determine which interface should be called in any given expression.  Such differentiation is guaranteed if the interfaces of the two functions are not equivalent.  The documentation for an overloaded function lists the separate interfaces in the syntax of that function.  For example:  MyFunction  &(a$, c$)  MyFunction  &(a$, b&, d&)  An overloaded function is called, like any other function, using the function name, return type, and the appropriate parameters.  For example:  MyFunction  &(a, b, d);  The EPM parser tries to determine the appropriate function to call by using a trial-and-error approach.  The parser tries each overloaded function until one is found that parses successfully.  If none of the functions are successful, the syntax error for the last function tried is returned.

For example, var charges#{} defines a hash of real data type.  Hashes are referenced using the following syntax:  <hash name><scalar type>{<expression>}  where <expression> returns a string; for example, var custname${'name'} := 'Smith';  The following table lists examples for the usage of hashes.  Example  Description  a${}  Accesses the hash as a whole.  var b?{};b${'SERVICE_NAME'}{} := a${};  Assigns a hash to a hash element.  b${'SERVICE_NAME'}{'Old'} := 'Hello';  Assigns an element to a two-dimensional hash.  var b?{};b${'SERVICE_NAME'}[] := a$[];  Assigns an array to a hash element.  b${'SERVICE_NAME'}[0] := 'FirstValue';  Assigns an array element within a hash.  There is no limit to the depth at which arrays or hashes can be nested.  Nested arrays and hashes are implicitly created as required and are always of unknown type.  Only hashes of unknown type support nested arrays and hashes.  A hash cannot be declared with multiple dimensions.  For example, the following is incorrect:  var a?{}{};.  To create a multi-dimensional hash, a single dimensional hash of unknown type must first be declared, and then the nested hashes (or arrays) accessed as required.  A hash variable is identified by its name only, as opposed to scalar variables, which are identified by name and type.  For example, the following is incorrect:  var a&{}, a${};  The variable a has been declared to be of type integer hash, and cannot be declared to be of type string hash.  The purpose of this is to allow hash elements to use the type character; for example:  var a?{};<br>a?{'SERVICE_NAME'} := ' a string';<br># Trim leading spaces from first Array element.<br>a${'SERVICE_NAME'} := ltrim(a${'SERVICE_NAME'});<br>#Could also say<br>a?{'SERVICE_NAME'} := ltrim(a${'SERVICE_NAME'});<br>#or <br>a?{'SERVICE_NAME'} := ltrim(to_string(a?{'SERVICE_NAME'}));  a${'SERVICE_NAME'} is not equivalent to to_string(a?{'SERVICE_NAME'}).  a${'SERVICE_NAME'} results in a runtime error if the value being accessed is not a string, while to_string(a${'SERVICE_NAME'}) converts the value to a string (using default formats for integers, reals, and dates) if it is not already a string.  In general, the value accessed must be of the type specified, or a runtime error occurs.  The exception is that casting between integers and reals is permitted; however, accessing a real value as an integer changes the value stored in the element to an integer, and accessing an integer as a real value changes the value stored in the element to a real value; for example:  var a?{};<br>a#{'SERVICE_NAME'} := 1.1;<br>if (a&{'SERVICE_NAME'} > 0) then print(a#{'SERVICE_NAME'}); # This prints 1, NOT 1.1  "},{"id":163,"title":"High Availability","url":"4531.htm","text":"Convergent Billing supports an installation within a highly available system.

Each machine in a Convergent Billing cluster must have its own Authentication Server and, therefore, its own LICENCE configuration item.  The Authentication Server also monitors the workload, issuing warnings as the maximum permitted level for each entity (user, customer, customer node, or service instance) is approached.  The following action is taken when the workload reaches its maximum permitted levels:  If the number of concurrent users is exceeded, additional users are not permitted to log in.  If the number of active services is exceeded, rating and billing are disabled.  If the number of active customers or customer nodes is exceeded, billing is disabled.  However, Convergent Billing will remain available for work on entities created within the workload limit.  The licence does not distinguish between temporary and permanent services.  For example, GSM roamers and open access services (IGF) are treated in the same way as permanent services when the Authentication Server assesses workload.  The Authentication server also checks the currency of the licence each time a user logs in.  If an invalid licence signature is detected or licence recalculation is overdue, the Authentication Server automatically initiates a task to perform a licence recalculation.  Users are unable to log in until the licence recalculation task is successful.  No further licence recalculations are issued by the Authentication server for 30 minutes.

For example, a list can contain the numbers frequently called by a specific customer, a list of areas serviced by a specific substation, or a list of the area codes that form the central business district of a specific city.  As in the case of service types, it is inefficient and often impractical to hard-code information into Convergent Billing.  For this reason, a derived attribute can be defined, with the type of information held in the associated list.  Like equipment types, the values in the derived attribute are not defined during product definition but entered in response to information supplied by the customer.  When a derived attribute, with an evaluation type of List, is evaluated, the value of a conditional expression is compared to each of the values defined in the derived attribute.  The derived attribute returns TRUE (a non-zero value) if the given value is defined in the derived attribute, or returns FALSE (zero) if the given value is not defined in the list.  The most common use for a derived attribute, with an evaluation type of List, is used to group frequently called numbers so that special tariffs can be applied, and customers can nominate up to five B party phone numbers that they call frequently.  The specified numbers (entered by a user on the Lists tab on Customer Detail form) are stored in a derived attribute and whenever that customer makes a call, the B party phone number is compared to the numbers in the derived attribute.  If a match is found, the special tariff is applied; if no match is found, the normal call tariff for that customer is applied.  The application environment determines the options available for derived attribute storage and use.  Derived attributes processed in the Billing application environment, can be used in Customer, Customer Node, Normalised Event, and Service contexts, and stored in Customer, Customer Node, Facility Group, and Service contexts.  Derived attributes processed in the Rating application environment, can be used in the Service context, and stored in Facility Group and Service contexts. Derived attributes can be either master or slaves.  Master and slave derived attributes share the same data, but the slave derived attribute may redefine how the common data is accessed.  A derived attribute can also be used to define a list to look up facilities in a facility group and then specify tariff eligibility criteria.  The list indicates whether a specific facility is in a facility group and therefore whether tariffs associated with that facility should be applied.

Base products may be associated with a product offer.  Companion products, which add tariffs (charges) and list objects to allow an alternative tariff regime to be applied to a base product.  Each base product has associated with it at least one, and possibly many, services (and any associated equipment).

Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Base Product and Product Group.

The copy or product instance of the product definition is unique within the Convergent Billing database.  Specific combination of services and the associated tariff structure offered to a customer based on the framework provided by the corresponding product definition.

Referred to as a Purchased Product in Customer Management.  Context:  Convergent Billing, Customer Management  See also Product Definition and Product Model.  More than one active instance of the same companion product can be assigned to a single base product using one or more product offers or directly, if specified in the definition of the companion product.  Having the same companion product assigned to a single base product is only useful for activation, cancellation, entitlements, and recurring charges generated by the RGP, because multiple companion products of the same name do not influence rating or billing behaviour.  A completed product instance has a status of Active.  A product instance is completed when the following conditions are met:  It has at least one Active service.  All mandatory services and equipment have been created and allocated.  Optional services and equipment that have been added, are created and allocated.  A product instance is automatically completed and its status changed to Active when:  The maximum number of services and equipment have been created.  Optional components have not been specified.  A product instance that is not yet complete (that is, a product having a status of Product Creation) can be deleted.  When a product instance is created for a customer, that instance can be modified whenever required.  For example, initially the customer may only want to use one of the available facility groups, then at a later date request the use of additional facility groups.  A product instance can change to be incomplete while in a status of Active if:   New optional services or equipment are added manually, but not created or allocated.  A product offer changes by:  Adding new mandatory services or equipment.  Reducing the maximum permitted number of services for a specific service type, leaving too many services allocated.  After all new services and equipment have been assigned, the product instance is automatically re-completed.   Cancelling a product instance changes the status of the product instance and each of its constituent services, facility groups, and companion products to Cancelled.  At some later time, the product instance and its associated services can be deleted if all outstanding items for the product and its services have been completed.  Product instances that are not associated with product offers can also be upgraded; this requires a different base product to be assigned to the customer as a replacement for their product.   Upgrading refers to replacing the product on which the product instance is based.  Replacing the base product can therefore result in an upgrade or downgrade of the base product.  A product instance must be replaced if:  The base product does not meet the customer&#8217;s new requirements.  Companion products (if any) for the base product do not allow the customer&#8217;s new requirements to be met.  A new service number usually needs to be assigned when a base product assigned to a customer needs to be replaced.  For example, if a customer is assigned a GSM phone with voice-only capability and that customer wants to upgrade to a GSM phone with voice and data capability, a new product must be assigned to replace the product, and also a new service number.  A base product can only be replaced with a compatible base product.  If required, product instances can also be moved between customer nodes in the same hierarchy or between nodes in different hierarchies.  A base product instance (and its associated services and companion product instances) can be moved from one customer node to another in a customer hierarchy (some restrictions apply).  A move is achieved by dragging the required product instance from its current customer node (referred to as the source node) and dropping it onto another node (referred to as the target node).  The source node and target node can be in the same customer hierarchy or different hierarchies.  The following restrictions apply when moving a product instance:  A product cannot be upgraded or moved if the product instance was created as part of a product offer.  A product cannot be moved if its owning customer or target customer is blacklisted at any time during the move period and the user does not have access to view blacklisted customers on the Customer Form.  A product cannot be upgraded or moved if the product instance is cancelled, moved, or upgraded at the effective start date or any later date.   A product must be assigned to a customer node.  A product dragged over a root node or blank space of the hierarchy panel cannot be dropped.   Some information regarding the lists and charge categories may need to be entered (when prompted) before the product instance move can be completed.  If a product instance is moved, any changes made to it before or after the move start date are not carried over in the move.  For example, if the product instance is moved at an effective date before an equipment allocation change, following the move the variation of equipment allocation is not reflected.  A warning is displayed so the user can cancel the move.   When dropped onto the target node, customer node lists, customer lists, customer node charge categories, customer charge categories, and start date are generated for the target node as though a new product instance was being created for that node.  Some information regarding charge categories may therefore need to be entered (when prompted) before the product instance move can be completed successfully.  If a product instance is moved on the same day it is created, any activation charges are carried over to the new customer node.  Because of the move, the service accounts are mapped from the source customer node to equivalent accounts on the target customer node.  Any non-invoiced usage charges posted on or after the date the product instance is moved, are moved across to the new accounts.  Recurring charges, such as rentals, are posted to the new accounts the next time the Rental Generation Process (RGP) is run as part of the normal billing cycle.

Progression continues until the initial query is resolved and a response is made to the customer.  The progression of a query from creation to resolution, using one or more work groups, is referred to as the query workflow.  [[FigureXref:53615-2]] displays the query progression.  [[Figure:53615-2]]  Query Progression  Query workflow ensures that each query is resolved in the fastest possible time and in the most efficient manner, regardless of the query type.  While a query remains unresolved, it is regarded as being open.  Until it is resolved, it is regarded as being closed.  When a query is forwarded to a work group, that work group actually receives a copy of the query and uses the copy as their &#8216;working&#8217; document.  The &#8216;working&#8217; document is referred to as a progression and is used to record any actions taken by the work group and, where possible, the solution to the original query.  Document used to record the actions taken by a work group to resolve a query.  If the query cannot be resolved by the current work group, that work group adds resolution text to the progression before forwarding the query to another work group.    Each progression therefore contains progress text (detailing the actions taken by a previous work group) and resolution text (detailing the actions performed by the current work group to resolve the query).  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Progress, Progress Text, Query Text, and Resolution Text.  To progress a query:  View the appropriate customer query.  Click the Progress button.  A message is displayed, prompting confirmation that the query is to be progressed to the specified work force.  By default, the work force displayed is that associated with the query type selected.  If required, select an alternative work force.  Click Yes to progress the query to the nominated work force.  Need more information on queries?  If the query cannot be resolved by the nominated work group, that work group adds text to the progression (known as resolution text) stating what actions were taken and what progress was made, and forwards a copy of the progression to the next work group.  The resolution text copied from the previous progression becomes the progress text on which the new work group bases its actions.  The process of forwarding a copy of a progression to the next work group continues until a work group can resolve the query.  At this point, a copy of the text stating how the query can be resolved is recorded against the original query and the query is deemed to be closed.  The query workflow mechanism ensures that each progression and the original query are retained and can be viewed.  Text on which a work group bases its actions.

In Convergent Billing, any event that results in a charge or benefit being passed on to a customer can be input to, or generated within, the system.    Events can originate from any source of charge information, including network elements, other service providers, other mediation systems, customer contacts such as one-off rebates, service enquiries, and faults).  All such events can be input to Convergent Billing if the format of the data is known and is consistent for each type of input.  Because Convergent Billing does not restrict data input to call data records, the term event record refers to a record that contains information that may result in a charge or benefit being passed on to a customer.  [[FigureXref:60348-1]] displays the rating and billing process.  [[Figure:60348-1]]  Rating and Billing Process  The full rating and billing process is divided into the following logical operations:  Balance Management, which provides service authorisation, advice of charge information, and customer credit reservations.  Event Normalisation, in which input data is converted into a standard record format.  The output from this stage is a set of normalised event records.  Event Rating, in which the normalised event records are rated (costed) by applying the appropriate tariffs.  The output from this stage is a set of costed event charges.  Event output, in which the costed event records are stored in the Convergent Billing database.  Billing, in which the costed event records are aggregated and any applicable discounts are applied, using Convergent Billing server processes.  The output from this stage is a set of billing data records.  Invoicing, in which billing data is combined with customer detail records and incorporated into an invoice or statement.  Invoice distribution or output, in which invoices and statements are printed or converted for electronic distribution.  "},{"id":211,"title":"Event Normalisation","url":"2926.htm","text":"Convergent Billing provides facilities to input events from an almost unlimited number of source types to support the production of a single, consolidated bill.  The sources can include call data records, switch data records, and pre-billed records of services from other service providers for re-billing.  In addition to handling 'external' events, Convergent Billing also generates internal events (using a process known as the Rental Generation Process), which are used as the basis for obtaining recurring charges (for example, line and appliance rentals).  Whatever its source, the event data is converted into a standard record format in a process referred to as event normalisation.  The records resulting from this process are referred to as normalised events.  Each data field in a normalised event is stored as a direct variable and is therefore available for use in tariff calculations during event rating.  Related Topics  Normalised Event Type  Normalised Event File Type  "},{"id":212,"title":"Event Rating","url":"60349.htm","text":"Event rating is the process in which normalised event records are rated (costed) to produce charges.  The rating engine performs all rating, which allows the construction of charges based on service data and event records.  Flexible Tariffs  The key to the rating engine is its power and flexibility which allows complex tariff regimes to be handled easily, and new products and tariffs to be introduced quickly and efficiently.  The rating engine has the ability to accept configuration changes to tariffs, derived attributes, and product definitions while maintaining availability.  Another equally important aspect of the rating engine is its ability to apply different tariff types to the same normalised event record.  Known as parallel tariffing, it is possible to apply separate tariffs that calculate charges to customers, commissions, taxes (such as VAT or GST), general levies, competitor's tariffs (for bill comparisons), and loyalty points.  Parallel tariffing greatly simplifies event record processing as each event record requires only a single pass through the rating.  In addition, it provides simpler, more effective auditing.  Recurring Charges  The rating engine is also used to calculate recurring charges such as line and appliance rentals.  The Rental Generation Process (RGP) generates the events used for these calculations.  The RGP, for each event, identifies the service, product, or facility group used, and the proportion of the full recurring charge to be applied (if the service was not active for the full charge period and prorating is applicable).  Like 'external' events, the events generated by the RGP are normalised and then forwarded to the rating engine to generate the appropriate charges.  Real-time recurring tariffs (for example, to charge for weekly access to video content) are not evaluated by the RGP.  They are evaluated when generating allocations for entitlements that are associated with real-time tariffs.  Tracking Revenue  Normalised event file transactions are generated during rating, when usage normalised events are rated and rating charges are generated, to track revenue.  The rating engine uses the rating subtotal cache to track accrued revenue generated from rated events.  The rating subtotal cache aggregates usage charges per normalised event file within an accounting period, guided to a specific GL guidance entity.  Rating Processes  While event normalisation and rating are displayed in the graphic as separate processes, both processes are combined by the rating engine, converting events supplied as input to Convergent Billing for normalisation into rated events by using the tariffs defined for each service and customer.  For more information about the structure of the underlying processes, refer to the System Operations Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing.  "},{"id":213,"title":"Billing","url":"2945.htm","text":"During this stage, the normalised events and charges output by the rating engine are processed by the billing engine to generate billing data records.  Essentially, the billing engine is identical to the rating engine in that it applies tariffs to the input data to generate the output data and supports parallel tariffing, but there are two major differences.  Firstly, unlike the rating engine (which applies tariffs to individual data records), the billing engine applies tariffs to aggregated data records.  Aggregation means that the individual charges are aggregated (grouped) into one or more predefined groups for the purpose of obtaining a total value or charge for that grouping.  In general, charges are aggregated according to the predefined customer hierarchy so that totals can be obtained for normalised events, services, individual and child customer nodes, and customers.  Secondly, the tariffs applied to the aggregated records are generally discount tariffs (benefits) rather than charge tariffs.  For example, if a customer's usage is higher than a pre-set limit for the specified billing cycle then a volume discount could be applied to the total cost of the calls.  In addition, it is possible to generate:  Invoices, which are sent out to the customer for payment.  Temporary statements, which can be used for quality assurance purposes or for customer information.  Financial Reporting  During billing, the BGP creates GL guidance records to:  Map the correct GL codes to invoice transactions for rental and rental adjustment events.  Record the state changes for rating charges.  The BGP tracks the financial state change of a charge when an invoice is applied to a customer account.    Invoice receivable type history records are created based on the amounts aggregated to each accounts receivable GL code for Billed and Earned (BE) charges for each invoice.  For more information about GL guidance records and invoice receivable types, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview.  "},{"id":214,"title":"Invoicing","url":"2947.htm","text":"The final stages of the Convergent Billing rating and billing process involve the production and distribution of invoices.  During invoicing, the billed data records (both individual and aggregated) are combined with customer detail records and incorporated into an invoice template to generate a set of invoices.  Invoices can be produced according to scheduled invoice cycles in response to a customer or management enquiry.  Such cycles can be defined on any periodic basis required.  "},{"id":215,"title":"Invoice Distribution","url":"2947.htm#o2949","text":"When generated, invoices can be sorted into groups using multiple keys (for example, in a single pass, they can be sorted into states, then regions within states, and finally, postcodes within regions) and subsequently distributed in either hardcopy or softcopy formats using a number of different media.  Invoices consist of a number of sections, each section providing details about specific charges (or benefits) that have been applied.  The charges displayed can be for individual event records or for aggregated records.  For example, a standard invoice for a new retail customer would include three separate sections detailing the once-off charge for installation, recurring charges for line rental and appliance rental, and lastly details of charges for usage.    Typically usage charges for local calls are displayed as an aggregated total, whereas usage charges for STD and IDD calls are displayed as itemised and as an aggregated total.  The invoice templates use macros to 'pull in' the appropriate invoice sections.  For example, if a customer subscribes to a frequently-called number plan, an invoice section that details the monthly subscription and the calls to which the appropriate discount was applied, is pulled into the customer's standard invoice.  During product design, consider whether the values of tariffs and subtotals being defined need to be included in an invoice section.  Using an existing invoice section is possible, but it is more likely that a new invoice section will need to be defined.  In more complicated cases, a new invoice template may need to be defined.  "},{"id":216,"title":"Rating Subtotal Options","url":"1708.htm","text":"Rating subtotals are set for either a certain date range or for the customer's bill cycle.  If the subtotal is set for the customer's bill cycle, it obtains its aggregation date range from that customer node and uses this range when accessing the rating subtotal cache.  Rating subtotals do not generate charge records; that is, many of the billing subtotal attributes (applicable to charge record generation) do not apply to rating subtotals (for example, currency or receivable types).  A rating subtotal can be set up to use another subtotal as its aggregate base.  If a subtotal uses another subtotal's aggregation, it is a 'slave' to that 'master'.  There is a many-to-one relationship between slave and master subtotals (that is, a master can have many slaves, but a slave only one master).  Slaves cannot perform their own direct aggregation and are only able to retrieve the aggregated amount from their master.  When evaluated, slave subtotals calculate their aggregation period and then use their master subtotal's ID to retrieve from the Rating Subtotal cache the sum of the master's aggregation periods equivalent to the slave's aggregation period.  Master and slave subtotal relationships have the following restrictions:  A master subtotal and its slave must share the same context.  A master subtotal and its slave must be of the same data type.  A slave subtotal may not have any terms and therefore may not perform any aggregation in its own right.  A slave subtotal's aggregation period must be a whole number multiple of the aggregation period of its master.  A master subtotal and its slave must have the same effective start and effective end dates.  If a slave subtotal is dependent on a bill cycle for its aggregation date range, either its master must also be dependent on a bill cycle or its master's aggregation date range must be a single day.

For each event received by the rating engine, either an acknowledgment message or an event error message is returned to the originator.  An acknowledgment is sent if the event was successfully decoded; otherwise, an event error message is sent which both locates the problem in the event record and indicates the reason for the error.  After normalisation and rating, the rating engine transmits each event, with its resultant charges, in a charge message.  The maximum number of charges that can be transmitted in a single charge message is 64.  In addition, the size of the resultant charge message cannot exceed 65536 bytes.  Of these 65536 bytes, 20480 bytes are reserved for encoded event details and an additional 228 bytes are reserved for Event Rating Protocol (ERP) overhead; therefore, the total number of bytes in all encoded charges in a single charge message cannot exceed 44828 bytes.  If an event generates too many charges to be output in a single charge message (that is, the size of the resultant charge message would exceed 65536 bytes), the rating engine outputs as many charges as possible in a single charge message.  Once an acknowledgment is received for this message, the rating engine transmits the remaining charges in additional charge messages until all the charges associated with the event have been sent.  For each charge message transmitted, the rating engine expects to receive an acknowledgment message before the next charge message is sent.  If a negative acknowledgment message is received, the rating engine re-transmits the charge message.  If an excessive number of negative acknowledgments are received for a charge message, or if no response is received, the rating engine transmits a diagnostic message and then closes the named pipe or TCP/IP socket connection.

A user can be associated with a person stored in the database, providing additional information about the user.  For more information about user, refer to the Security and Auditing Configuration Guide for Singleview.  Profiles are designed to provide access to the data and Convergent Billing forms required to carry out a user's function.  A profile is made up of one or more of the following four elements:  Security groups, which define the database entities that a user can access.  Security form roles, which define the menu items and forms available to a user.  Security function roles, which define the database remote functions that a user can access.  Work groups, which provide a mechanism for the management of customer queries.  Access levels define the level of security for the following profile entities:  Security Groups, restricting the operations a user can perform on data; for example, updating, inserting, and deleting records, or updating and deleting historical records.  Form roles, restricting the kind of operations a user can perform using a specific form; for example, viewing, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

As the services available at any one time vary depending on locality and availability, it is impractical for a product administrator to define a product using specific services.  For this reason, it is necessary to define the service components of a product more generically in terms of service types.  Defining the type (or category) of service has the following advantages over hardcoding a service into a product offering:  Flexibility  The user can offer one of several equivalent services, rather than being restricted to a single service offering.  Maintainability  The list of available services (having the specified service type) can be modified whenever required without affecting the product offering.  Easy introduction of new services  New services can be introduced whenever they are required, without affecting the costing of the product offering.  Up-to-date  The user is always able to select the current services associated with a specific service type.  Customisation  The list of available services can be customised to reflect local conditions and current market trends.  Service types can also define generic and default values for the services associated with that type and to define any service attributes for a specific service.  For example, default values for the types and quantities of equipment required by services of the specified service type can be defined.  Defining service types to be used in a product is a two step process:  Determine whether the service type exists.  Define a new service type (if required).  For inclusion in a product definition, it is only necessary to define the service type to be used; it is not necessary to define the services to be used as these have no bearing on how the product is defined or rated.  The services associated with a service type are defined by a user when they create a service instance for each service type specified in the product instance.  When a companion product is created, the service type of the base product must also be included in the companion product's list of service types; otherwise, the companion products tariff is not applied.

In large organisations, several levels of aggregation may be required for full breakdown of the total charges into charges for specific departments or types of service.  Event and charge details also need to be aggregated so that accurate calculations can be made for real-time services.  Credit monitoring of postpaid customers requires real-time access to the customer account information (including account balance, current outstanding usage amounts, and the customer's credit limit).  To provide these services, Convergent Billing allows individual costed data records to be aggregated (or subtotalled) in the billing engine at each level of the customer hierarchy.  Rating aggregations are supported for individual customers and services.   To facilitate the storage of aggregations, Convergent Billing supports a special type of variable known as a subtotal.  A subtotal specifies one or more subtotal terms that define the aggregation to be performed using the method specified by one of the following aggregation functions:  Summation, in which the value of the subtotal is calculated by summing the values of a subtotal term for each match to a costed data record.  Minimum, in which the value of the subtotal is taken as the minimum calculated value of each eligible subtotal term.  Maximum, in which the value of the subtotal is taken as the maximum calculated value of each eligible subtotal term.  The only aggregation function supported for rating subtotals is summation (minimum and maximum aggregation is not supported).  For date type subtotals, only maximum and minimum aggregation is allowed.  The data type returned by each subtotal term must be the same as the data type defined for the subtotal.  Subtotals can have a data type of real, integer, real hash, or integer hash.  Billing subtotals can also have the data types of date, date hash, date array, real array, and integer array.    Subtotal terms are selected for aggregation in four stages. In the:  First stage, the costed data records to be aggregated are identified by application, context, and eligibility.  Second stage, subtotal eligibility criteria are evaluated to determine which subtotal definitions are applicable.  Third stage, the subtotal term is evaluated to calculate the value to be passed to the aggregation function.  Fourth stage, the specified aggregation function is applied to obtain the required subtotal.  A subtotal is defined as a variable so that the aggregated data value it contains is available for use in other expressions in the billing process.  Billing subtotals can be accessed using their variable name.  For example, one common use of a subtotal in the billing process is in discount tariff expressions, which are generally applied to aggregated billing data.  In these cases, the subtotal variable (containing the summed value of a set of costed data records) is used in the discount tariff expression to calculate the applicable discount.  Rating subtotals can be accessed during rating using their variable name in the same way that they are used in billing.  Rating subtotals can also be accessed and manually aggregated using available built-in EPM functions.  Some of these functions are only available during rating; it is only possible to aggregate the value of a rating subtotal by rating an event.

Real-time tariffs can be used to generate activation, cancellation, or recurring charges (see the Customer Care and Product Configuration Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing).  A tariff is a variable, the value of which is defined by a charge expression.  Like other expressions defined in Convergent Billing, the charge expression consists of operators and variables (known as charge values) that, when evaluated, returns a single value.  Usually the relevant charge values for inclusion in the charge expression are obtained from a table of values, known as a tariff table.  The tariff table associates each set of charge values with a set of conditions (also contained in the tariff table).  The conditional expressions defined for each condition determine which set of charge values are to be used in the charge expression.  To calculate a specific tariff, a set of input values from an event record is compared to each set of conditions defined in the tariff table.  When the first set of conditions is reached that matches the set of input values, the charge values associated with that set of conditions are substituted into the charge expression.  The expression is then evaluated and a value for the tariff returned.  Every condition in a set of conditions must be satisfied by the input values for a match to be found.  If no match is found, a default charge expression is used to return a value for the tariff.  To restrict the number of tariffs applied to an event, the 'pool' of available tariffs must be reduced by selectively reducing the number of tariffs applicable to that event.  For example, when the rating engine is used to rate a normalised event, the rating engine selects from the full list of valid tariffs:  All global tariffs (those in which the Global Event? check box is selected) and any tariffs where the application environment is set to Rating and the context is set to Normalised Event.  Product-specific tariffs (defined during product definition and selected when the product instance is created for a customer).  Product specific tariffs form the set of tariffs associated with each service defined in the product and are therefore the only set of tariffs that can be applied to this customer using this service.  Tariffs with the highest priority that have the same type, application environment, and context.  Context:  Convergent Billing  Attribute of a tariff that determines which tariff is applied in a product definition.  A tariff with a higher priority (lower numerical value) overrides a tariff with a lower priority (higher numerical value) only if they have the same type, application environment, and context.  A tariff with no priority cannot be overridden.  Context:  Process Engine  Used for cases and actions to be assigned a priority.  See also Tariff and Product Definition.  Tariffs whose eligibility criteria validate them for the event.  An invalid tariff is one that has a non-scalar data type and all its key expressions evaluate to undefined values.  All remaining tariffs are applied to the specified event.  Tariffs are used in both the rating and billing engines.  A specific tariff, however, can only be used in one or the other, depending on which application environment is specified in its definition.  Typically, usage and recurring tariffs are used in the rating engine, and discount, recurring, and tax tariffs are used in the billing engine:  In the rating engine, a tariff is applied to a normalised event record to generate a charge record.  In fact, multiple tariffs can be applied to the normalised event record, thereby generating multiple charge records from a single normalised event.  For example, both a usage tariff and a comparative tariff can be applied to a normalised event record to calculate the standard cost of that event, and the cost if the comparative rating plan is used.  In the billing engine, tariffs can be applied to charge records to generate billed data records.  For example, charge records for a customer can be aggregated to calculate the total amount owed by that customer for a specific service for the current billing period.  A discount tariff can then be applied to the total amount owed.  As in the rating engine, multiple tariffs can be applied to a single charge record in the billing engine.  A tax tariff can be applied to the total amount owed by a customer in addition to the discount tariff.  The billing engine can also apply multiple tariffs to aggregated charge records.  Tariffs generated at billing time (Billing application environment) should only be accessed by referencing the tariff as a variable (that is, by name).  Access to billing tariffs (or subtotals) using the following methods is not reliable and should not be used:  ChgInputBilledCharge#  SQL during the BGP operation to try and access CHARGE records generated by billing tariffs.   These two techniques only work if the internal processing order employed by the BGP is correct.  Because this order is not controlled by the configurer, it is impossible to ensure reliability of access using either method.  For more information about how context is processed, refer to the Configuration Fundamentals Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing.  Usually the cost information generated by a tariff is included on an invoice or a statement, but can be excluded if it is not required.  For example, a tariff can be specified as non-billable, in which case the tariff values are ignored when invoice data record values are passed to the invoice generation program.  Alternatively, a tariff that returns a zero value can either be recorded in the CHARGE table so that it can be included in any subtotals, or handled as a rating or billing error.  Keyed tariffs allow tariffs to be grouped so that multiple values can be applied to a single event.  In this way, a single tariff can replace a number of individual tariffs of the same type or generate multiple charges.  Keyed tariffs have a data type of Real Array or Real Hash and return an array of tariff values or a hash of tariff values, respectively.  To appreciate the power and flexibility of tariffs in Convergent Billing, it is first necessary to have an understanding of the generic components of tariffs including:  Derived Attributes  Direct Variables  Functions  Local Constants  Subtotals  Tariffs are specified in a two stage process:  Tariff definition, in which the basic properties of the tariff are entered, the structure of the tariff table is defined, and the charge expression for the tariff is entered.  Tariff table definition, in which values for the conditions and charges are entered into the tariff table.  The tariff name must be unique for the date range of the tariff when compared to all other variables (for example, functions, derived attributes, subtotals, tariffs, and direct variables).  The rules for naming are:  For a scalar data type, the name and data type combination must be unique when compared to other variables.  For a hash type, the name must be unique when compared to other hash type variables.  For an array type, the name must be unique when compared to other array type variables.

Invoices and statements can contain summarised information, line-by-line details, or a mixture of both.  The Invoice Generation Process (IGP) takes billing data from Convergent Billing (including direct variables and subtotals) and inserts them into an invoice or statement using a set of templates specified using the Invoicing tab and Invoice Format... button on the Customer Detail form.  Dunning letters to customers whose accounts are overdue are generated in the same way as invoices and statements, using templates into which the appropriate data is inserted.  Adjustment images (for example, credit and debit notes) represent adjustments created by a user and assigned to a customer account.  Adjustment images are generated using the Generate Adjustment Images task, and output using the Print Adjustments task.  Invoices, statements, adjustments, or dunning letters consist of a hierarchy of templates, based on predefined template types.  Each template type has a default database view associated with it, and the template can use any direct variable defined in the view, either by inserting its value directly in the document or by using it in expressions and functions.  Data can also be included from database views other than the default view for the specified template type.

The Convergent Billing database and server support UTF-8 encoding.  The TRE supports both UTF-8 encoding and UTF-16 encoding, enabling integration with many applications that use UTF-16, including Windows.

Therefore, in an internationalisation context, data can be entered, viewed, and manipulated in the Convergent Billing client in any language supported by the character set of the PC's locale.  The following constraints apply to Convergent Billing's support of Unicode:  The Convergent Billing client is not Unicode enabled, so when Unicode is used, conversions are performed between Unicode and the character set as defined by the PC's locale.  Separate client machines are required for each distinct character set as each Convergent Billing client can only correctly display characters corresponding to the locale for which the PC is configured.

String columns in the Convergent Billing database are of fixed byte size; for example, the customer name column is 80 bytes.  As UTF-8 encoding is a variable length byte encoding between one and four bytes, depending on the characters stored in a column, the effective number of characters stored in a column may be fewer than the column size.

The most common example of this is the @value<type> variable, used in the Convergent Billing client for encoding and decoding sequence or serial numbers.  Users can define an expression to format the account number for a customer node by entering an expression such as:  'ACC' + to_string (@value&, '00000000')  The expression takes the account ID of the account being declared in the database, converts it to a string of eight numerals, and prefixes it with the letters 'ACC'.

The logical data model is designed to minimise the meta model effect.  Data abstraction  Views represent the data in a format that reflects the service provider's conceptual view of the data (for example, customers, contacts, accounts, or products).

The logical data model provides an abstraction layer that helps protect investment placed in external development.  Convergent Billing provides the following types of views:  Normal  TRE  Database  TRE views and database views can be customised, allowing implementation-specific views to be preserved during upgrades.  For example, hints can be added to view definitions for performance tuning.  A knowledge of SQL and the purpose and use of each view is required for customising views.

String Columns and Unicode  The string columns in the Convergent Billing database have fixed byte sizes.  Characters encoded using UTF-8 may be single-byte or multi-byte.

Need more information on charge categories?  Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

Controls the representation of an entity's attributes.   For users of Singleview Convergent Billing, an attribute type defines the format, characteristics, and validation rules for a form field.   Attribute types are the major components for entity validation.  Based on a reference type, they also define the representation of an entity's attributes externally, allowing the entity's data model to be tailored for integration with external systems.  They can also define additional non-stored attributes that are derived from an entity's stored attributes.   Attribute types are defined independently of the data entry fields to which they relate, which allows the same attribute type to be used for multiple fields.  Context:  Convergent Billing, Process Engine  See also Derived Attribute, Derived Non-Stored Attribute, and Reference Type.  The upper part of the form displays, or allows entry of, basic details about the attribute type.  The lower part of the form consists of the following tabs:  Display  The Display tab is used to:  Specify how entered data is to be displayed in a field (for example, field label, field width, display format, an edit mask, and alignment of data entered).  Associate help with the field by entering hint text, and selecting a help entry definition.  Properties  The Properties tab is used to define the properties of a field by specifying the type of attribute type, using a various options.  For example, the attribute type can be based on a reference type, SQL query, expression, data type, or the original field.  The attribute type can also be based on whether the field is mandatory, how the field is displayed (visible, enabled, can be updated), type of data that can be entered, restrictions on the data that can be entered, default value, and field validation.  Security  The Security tab is used to configure:  Fields to be masked or encrypted.  This option is not available for attribute types based on reference type, SQL query, or expression.  Field security to determine users who can view a field, users who can update a field, and whether a field is disabled or enabled for specified users.  SQL  The fields on the SQL tab are used to specify a general SQL statement that defines values that can be set for this attribute type.  Defining the values is similar to defining a reference type in that it results in a drop-down list being displayed for the attribute type.    The SQL tab is enabled only when the SQL Query option is selected in the Attribute type is based on field.  When using an SQL query or expression, items can be defined as available or unavailable for selection from the drop-down list.

Expression  This tab is used to specify an expression that defines the possible values that can be displayed for the attribute type. Defining an expression is similar to defining a reference type in that it results in a drop-down list being displayed for the attribute type.   The Expression tab is enabled only when the Expression option is selected in the Attribute type is based on group on the Properties tab.  Integration  The Integration tab is used to define attribute types that tailor a Convergent Billing entity's data model for integration with external systems.

Need more information on charge categories?  Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

Need more information on charge categories?  Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

Context:  Convergent Billing, Customer Management  See also Contact and Secondary Contact.  A query is not assigned to that contact.  Any customer enquiry recorded and subsequently processed is referred to as a query.  [[FigureXref:60287-1]] displays the query process.  [[Figure:60287-1]]  Query Process  A query can be recorded against a customer (existing or potential) or, more rarely, against a contact.  Recording a query against a contact is used to accurately record information reported by customers, and for an organisation to obtain statistical information on the types of inquiry being handled and the frequency of each type.  A query must first be recorded (usually by the person who deals directly with the customer making the enquiry) and then either resolved immediately or forwarded electronically to a work group to be resolved.  The act of forwarding the query to a work group is referred to as progressing the query.  If the designated work group cannot resolve the query, or can only provide a partial answer, that work group progresses (forwards) the query to another work group.  Progression continues until the initial query is resolved and a response is made to the customer.  The progression of a query from creation to resolution, using one or more work groups, is referred to as the query workflow.  [[FigureXref:60287-2]] displays the query progression.  [[Figure:60287-2]]  Query Progression  Query workflow ensures that each query is resolved in the fastest possible time and in the most efficient manner, regardless of the query type.  While a query remains unresolved, it is regarded as being open.  Until it is resolved, it is regarded as being closed.  When a query is forwarded to a work group, that work group actually receives a copy of the query and uses the copy as their &#8216;working&#8217; document.  The &#8216;working&#8217; document is referred to as a progression and is used to record any actions taken by the work group and, where possible, the solution to the original query.  Document used to record the actions taken by a work group to resolve a query.  If the query cannot be resolved by the current work group, that work group adds resolution text to the progression before forwarding the query to another work group.    Each progression therefore contains progress text (detailing the actions taken by a previous work group) and resolution text (detailing the actions performed by the current work group to resolve the query).  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Progress, Progress Text, Query Text, and Resolution Text.  To progress a query:  View the appropriate customer query.  Click the Progress button.  A message is displayed, prompting confirmation that the query is to be progressed to the specified work force.  By default, the work force displayed is that associated with the query type selected.  If required, select an alternative work force.  Click Yes to progress the query to the nominated work force.  Need more information on queries?  If the query cannot be resolved by the nominated work group, that work group adds text to the progression (known as resolution text) stating what actions were taken and what progress was made, and forwards a copy of the progression to the next work group.  The resolution text copied from the previous progression becomes the progress text on which the new work group bases its actions.  The process of forwarding a copy of a progression to the next work group continues until a work group can resolve the query.  At this point, a copy of the text stating how the query can be resolved is recorded against the original query and the query is deemed to be closed.  The query workflow mechanism ensures that each progression and the original query are retained and can be viewed.  Text on which a work group bases its actions.  The progress text is created as resolution text by the previous work group before progressing the query to the current work group.

"},{"id":355,"title":"Customer Hierarchy Confirm Move Form","url":"60374.htm","text":"The Customer Hierarchy Confirm Move form is used to confirm the move of one or more customer nodes or products.  Refer to Base Product and Companion Product.  Point in a customer hierarchy that represents a customer's primary account to which charges can be accrued.  Product instances and associated services can be created for each node.  Associated with each customer node is a reporting level, which determines whether that node receives an invoice, a statement, or neither.  For example, if an account is required for each division in a multi-national company, a separate customer node is used to represent each division&#8217;s account.  Customer nodes in the customer hierarchy are organised into a structure (usually mirroring the company&#8217;s organisational structure) that is similar to a family tree.  A family tree displays the relationship between members of a specific family.  Like a family tree, a customer hierarchy displays the relationship between customer nodes.  Context:  Convergent Billing, Customer Management  See also Child Customer Node, Customer Hierarchy, Customer, Customer Type, Parent Customer Node, Reporting Level, and Root Customer Node.  The upper part of the form displays information about the move.  The lower part of the form is used to specify the start and end dates for which the move is valid and to cancel the move.  Associated Actions  Moving a Customer Node  Restrictions on Moving a Customer Node  Move Multiple Customer Nodes  A child customer node can be moved:  To another location within the same hierarchy  Out of a hierarchy, creating a new root customer node  To a different hierarchy.  To perform one of these actions, the following privileges must be available:  Update privileges on the customer being moved.  View privileges on the customer node that will become the new parent customer node of the node being moved.  View privileges for blacklisted customers (if the customer node to be moved is blacklisted).  Privileges to move products or child customer nodes within a hierarchy.  Privileges to move products or child customer nodes between hierarchies.  Depending on the type of customer node move, preferences can be set to determine how the move is performed.  If changes to the customer records are required directly following the move, preferences can also be set to display the Customer Detail form for each of the moved customer nodes.  If this is the first move since logging in, the Move Preferences form is displayed automatically.  If not, and the move preferences need to be changed, they can be changed manually.  The following procedure assumes that the move preferences have been set.  To move a customer node:  Display and fully expand the customer hierarchy for the appropriate customer.  Use two instances of the Customer Hierarchy form if necessary.  If moving a customer node within a hierarchy or to a different hierarchy, select the customer node and drag and drop it on to the appropriate customer node.  If moving a customer node out of a hierarchy (that is, a child node is to become a root node), select the child node and drag and drop it onto the hierarchy node.  The Move Confirm form is displayed.    Enter the appropriate date range.  Depending on security settings, the Start Date and End Date fields consist of a single component, the date, or two components, date and time.  Click the Continue button.  The customer node being moved has its start date usually set to the customer hierarchy search date.  If this date is less than the current date and the user does not have historical update privileges, the start date is set to the current date.  The forms displayed throughout the rest of the move are determined by the move preferences previously selected.  The invoice cycle for all customers being moved is adjusted to be the invoice cycle of the new root customer node.  Need more information on hierarchies?  Moving Multiple Customer Nodes  Restrictions on Moving a Customer Node  Move a Customer Node  Multiple customer nodes can be moved only if they are a group of child nodes under the same parent node.  For example, if MegaWork's Melbourne and Sydney offices are both to be moved from the Sales Division and located directly under the head office in the hierarchy, both child nodes can be highlighted and moved simultaneously.  If this is the first move since logging in, the Move Preferences form is displayed automatically.  If not, and the move preferences need to be changed, they can be changed manually.  The following procedure assumes that the move preferences have been set.  To move multiple customer nodes:  Display and fully expand the customer hierarchy for the appropriate customer.  Use two instances of the Customer Hierarchy form if necessary.  If moving child nodes within a hierarchy or to a different hierarchy, select the appropriate nodes from the right-hand panel of the Customer Hierarchy form and drag and drop them onto the appropriate customer node on the left-hand panel of the form.  To select:  A group of customer nodes next to each other, hold down the Shift key, select the first node in the group, then the last node in the group.  All nodes in between the first and the last are automatically highlighted.  Multiple customer nodes not grouped together, hold down the Ctrl key, and then click each relevant node.  If moving customer nodes out of a hierarchy (that is, a group of child nodes are to become root nodes), select the nodes from the right-hand panel of the Customer Hierarchy form and drag and drop them onto the hierarchy node on the left-hand panel of the form.  The Move Confirm form is displayed.  Enter the appropriate date range and click the Continue button.  The forms displayed throughout the rest of the move are determined by the move preferences previously selected.  If one or more of the nodes fail to move, preferences can be set to do either of the following:  Cancel all the moves.  Move the nodes that can be moved and display a report detailing which moves failed, and why.  Need more information on hierarchies?  Moving a Product Instance  If this is the first move since logging in, the Move Preferences form is displayed automatically.  If not, and move preferences need to be changed, they can be changed manually.  The following procedure assumes that move preferences have been set.  When moving product instances between nodes in different customer hierarchies, use multiple instances of the Customer Hierarchy form to display both customer hierarchies simultaneously.  Restrictions on Moving a Product Instance  The following restrictions apply when moving a product instance:  A product cannot be upgraded or moved if the product instance was created as part of a product offer.  A product cannot be moved if its owning customer or target customer is blacklisted at any time during the move period and the user does not have access to view blacklisted customers on the Customer Form.  A product cannot be upgraded or moved if the product instance is cancelled, moved, or upgraded at the effective start date or any later date.   A product must be assigned to a customer node.  A product dragged over a root node or blank space of the hierarchy panel cannot be dropped.   Some information regarding the lists and charge categories may need to be entered (when prompted) before the product instance move can be completed.  If a product instance is moved, any changes made to it before or after the move start date are not carried over in the move.  For example, if the product instance is moved at an effective date before an equipment allocation change, following the move the variation of equipment allocation is not reflected.  A warning is displayed so the user can cancel the move.   To move a product instance:  Display the source node in the left-hand panel of the first instance of the Customer Hierarchy form.  Ensure that the details for the source node are displayed in the right-hand panel.  Select the Products option from the Display for Customer group to ensure that the source product is displayed.  Display the target node in the left-hand panel of the second instance of the Customer Hierarchy form.  Drag and drop the source product instance (located in the right-hand panel of the first instance of the Customer Hierarchy form) onto the target node (displayed in the left-hand panel of the second instance of the Customer Hierarchy form).  Ensure that the product instance and not the associated service is dragged and dropped.  To drag and drop a product instance, click the product instance and, while holding down the left mouse button, move the cursor into the left-hand panel until the target node is highlighted.  Now drop the product instance onto the target node by releasing the mouse button.  As the product instance is dragged from the right-hand to the left-hand panel, the cursor changes from one depicting a stop symbol to one depicting an arrow.

Refer to Base Product and Companion Product.  Point in a customer hierarchy that represents a customer's primary account to which charges can be accrued.  Product instances and associated services can be created for each node.  Associated with each customer node is a reporting level, which determines whether that node receives an invoice, a statement, or neither.  For example, if an account is required for each division in a multi-national company, a separate customer node is used to represent each division&#8217;s account.  Customer nodes in the customer hierarchy are organised into a structure (usually mirroring the company&#8217;s organisational structure) that is similar to a family tree.  A family tree displays the relationship between members of a specific family.  Like a family tree, a customer hierarchy displays the relationship between customer nodes.  Context:  Convergent Billing, Customer Management  See also Child Customer Node, Customer Hierarchy, Customer, Customer Type, Parent Customer Node, Reporting Level, and Root Customer Node.

To perform one of these actions, the following privileges must be available:  Update privileges on the customer being moved.  View privileges on the customer node that will become the new parent customer node of the node being moved.  View privileges for blacklisted customers (if the customer node to be moved is blacklisted).  Privileges to move products or child customer nodes within a hierarchy.  Privileges to move products or child customer nodes between hierarchies.  Depending on the type of customer node move, preferences can be set to determine how the move is performed.

Depending on security settings, the Start Date and End Date fields consist of a single component, the date, or two components, date and time.  Click the Continue button.  The customer node being moved has its start date usually set to the customer hierarchy search date.  If this date is less than the current date and the user does not have historical update privileges, the start date is set to the current date.

When moving product instances between nodes in different customer hierarchies, use multiple instances of the Customer Hierarchy form to display both customer hierarchies simultaneously.  Restrictions on Moving a Product Instance  The following restrictions apply when moving a product instance:  A product cannot be upgraded or moved if the product instance was created as part of a product offer.  A product cannot be moved if its owning customer or target customer is blacklisted at any time during the move period and the user does not have access to view blacklisted customers on the Customer Form.  A product cannot be upgraded or moved if the product instance is cancelled, moved, or upgraded at the effective start date or any later date.   A product must be assigned to a customer node.  A product dragged over a root node or blank space of the hierarchy panel cannot be dropped.   Some information regarding the lists and charge categories may need to be entered (when prompted) before the product instance move can be completed.  If a product instance is moved, any changes made to it before or after the move start date are not carried over in the move.  For example, if the product instance is moved at an effective date before an equipment allocation change, following the move the variation of equipment allocation is not reflected.  A warning is displayed so the user can cancel the move.   To move a product instance:  Display the source node in the left-hand panel of the first instance of the Customer Hierarchy form.

Need more information on charge categories?  Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

A Search Criteria group is displayed on the form if 'search' entity validation (using the Search Validation field) is defined on the Derived Attribute Definition form.  The Search Criteria section is displayed if entity validation is specified in the Search Validation field when defining the derived attribute array.  Search criteria can be used to filter the table rows displayed in the form.  Match Case and Wildcard check boxes are only available for string search fields.  If the Match Case check box is selected, a case-sensitive search is executed.  If the Wildcard check box is selected, the wildcard character % can be used in the string to represent zero or more unknown characters.  For example, &#8216;%value&#8217; returns 1value, onevalue, and twovalue.  When a filter is applied, another filter cannot be applied (further searches are conducted on the unfiltered array).  Reordering records while a filter is applied is not possible.  The Up Arrow and Down Arrow buttons at the bottom of the Derived Attribute Definition form are unavailable while a filter is applied.  If the Where clause is defined in the search entity validation, filtering fields are ignored.  If the Go To functionality is used, the specified row is returned regardless of filtering values.  Pre-commit and post-commit expressions are also ignored for search entity validation.  Rows can be inserted, updated, and deleted when filtering is applied.  Row insertion behaviour is configurable using the SYSTEM_CLIENT configuration items. The APPEND_ON_DA_TABLE_INSERT and DUPLICATE_ON_DA_TABLE_INSERT attributes in the SYSTEM_CLIENT configuration item (see the System Configuration Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing) control how rows are added to the form.  The default behaviour of the APPEND_ON_DA_TABLE_INSERT attribute is to append rows at the end of the derived attribute table.  If set to BOOLEAN_NM_FALSE, a row is inserted before the selected row. The sequence numbers of the selected row, and subsequent rows, are incremented by 1.  The default behaviour of the DUPLICATE_ON_DA_TABLE_INSERT attribute is to duplicate values to the new row. If set to BOOLEAN_NM_FALSE, the new row is blank.  The buttons at the bottom of the form are used to navigate through the rows in the derived attribute table.  The following three buttons ('Go To' functionality) at the bottom of the form are used to navigate through the rows in the derived attribute table:  Go to row number  Go to first record  Go to last record  The Go to row number button is used to go directly to a row by entering a row number in the text box to the left of the button and clicking the button.  The 100 rows before and after the entered row number are also returned.   When the Go to row number button is clicked, the form is cleared, and the required records are retrieved from the database.  Therefore, any filtering or sorting used in the grid is cleared when the button is clicked.  The Go to first record button is used to go to the first record displayed in the grid (filtering and sorting is not cleared).  The Go to last record button is used to go to the last record displayed in the grid (filtering and sorting is not cleared).  The Go to first record and Go to last record buttons display the first and last rows, respectively, displayed in the grid, not necessarily the first or last records in the derived attribute definition table.  For performance reasons, the Convergent Billing client only retrieves records from the database as they are required; therefore, the derived attribute definition table is not always retrieved when it is initially displayed in the client.  For example, for a table with 1000 records, only the first 32 may be initially retrieved and displayed.  When the user scrolls past row 32, the next set of records are retrieved.  Therefore, clicking the Go to last record button when the table is first displayed may take the user only to row 32, not the last row in the derived attribute definition table.

"},{"id":387,"title":"Entity Validation Definition Form","url":"2788.htm","text":"The Entity Validation Definition form is used to enter, view, and update an entity validation definition.  Used to customise fields, add fields to generic forms, validate fields and forms, and add field security.  It can also be used to customise an entity's data model using derived non-stored attribute types, attribute display labels, attribute interface labels, and custom key field functions.   Entity validation is used in conjunction with reference types, attribute types, lookup functions and context-sensitive help.  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Attribute Type and Reference Type.  The upper part of the form is used to enter basic details about the entity validation definition, select validation table and a parent table, specify key field functions, and enter validation expressions or post-commit expressions.  Contains variables that can be used in the default expression of an entity validation definition.  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Entity Validation and Validation Table.  Table used within entity validation that contains a group of generic fields, including general fields, which can be customised.  Each table represents a specific area such as accounts, addresses, adjustments, and so on.  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Entity Validation and Parent Table.  The lower part of the form is used to associate attribute types with generic Singleview Convergent Billing fields, use the Control Next feature, and enter default expressions.  The default expression in entity validation can execute almost any action; for example, assigning a default to a field, and printing a message.  To define a default for a field, the expression must contain the direct variable for the field referenced in the expression.  For example, to define a default of &#8216;500&#8217; for the General 4 field of the Customer Detail form, the entity validation defining that field would contain the following default expression:  evCustGeneral4$ := &#8217;500&#8217;;  where   evCustGeneral4$ is the direct variable for the General 4 field on the Customer Detail form.  Direct variables from both the validation table or parent table can be included in default expressions.  The Control Next feature is used to define intelligent defaulting and to configure fields to automatically change their configuration based on a value selected in another field.  For example, Control Next is used to configure the following scenarios if a user selects an option in one field:  More information is required based on that selection.  An additional field, used to enter further information, is displayed.    The characteristics of another field are inappropriate for the option selected, so the characteristics of the field are automatically modified.  The Control Next feature does not work on grids, except for derived attribute grids where child reference types are used.    Changing the configuration of fields based on the data entered in a separate field is achieved by allowing the attribute type assigned to one field to control the attribute type assigned to another field.    If the Control Next field (in an entity validation definition row) is set to Yes, the attribute type in that row has control over the attribute type in the row directly below it.  Depending on how the attribute types are set up, the Control Next feature can have the following effects:  If the controlling attribute type is based on a reference type that has a child attribute type associated with one of its reference items, that child attribute type overrides the attribute type in the next row when that reference item is selected.    The result is that the second field changes its configuration when an option is selected from the first field.  To display a new field on the form when an option is selected, an attribute type defining an invisible (or null) field must be defined.  The attribute type defining the blank field is then overridden and the new field is displayed.  If the controlling attribute is based on a reference type that has a child reference type associated with one of its reference items, that child reference type overrides any reference type specified in the attribute type in the next row when that reference item is selected.    The result is that the second field changes its reference list (drop-down list) when an option is selected in the first field.  Child reference types are supported only in derived attribute grids; they are not supported in other grids with entity validation.    For example, they are supported in the Derived Attribute Table form, Customer Lists, and Service Lists; they are not supported in the Payment Batch form, Adjustment Batch form, Customer Invoice Format form, and Customer Contacts form.  If the field being controlled has a default expression defined, that expression is evaluated when the field associated with the first attribute type is modified.  The above setup is used to define intelligent defaulting (automatically defaulting the value of a field based on data entered in a separate field).    Controls the representation of an entity's attributes.   For users of Singleview Convergent Billing, an attribute type defines the format, characteristics, and validation rules for a form field.   Attribute types are the major components for entity validation.  Based on a reference type, they also define the representation of an entity's attributes externally, allowing the entity's data model to be tailored for integration with external systems.  They can also define additional non-stored attributes that are derived from an entity's stored attributes.   Attribute types are defined independently of the data entry fields to which they relate, which allows the same attribute type to be used for multiple fields.

"},{"id":403,"title":"Expression List Form","url":"2961.htm","text":"The Expression List form is used to enter, view, and update details of an expression.  Combinations of operators (arithmetic and relational) and variables that return a single value when evaluated.  Variables used in an expression depend on the variable type, and the context and application environment in which the expression is being used.  Use of direct variables in expressions also depends on the defined database view.  Expressions are used in client and server processes.  In Process Engine, expressions can be used in searches, rule validations, parameters, and derivations; they can also be used to conditionally trigger the execution of EPM scripts.  Context:  Convergent Billing, Process Engine  See also Expression Block, Expression Parser Module (EPM), Expression Type, and Variable.  To enter an expression, do either of the following:  Place the cursor in the last expression field and press the Down Arrow key to display a new row in the grid below the last row.    Click the Insert button on the toolbar to insert a new row above the current row.  An expression can then be entered in the new row.  The sequence in which the expressions are executed can be changed using the Up and Down buttons.  Specific processing and conditions for some expression lists are:  Standard Tariff Eligibility Expression List  Specifies expressions that control the application of the tariff.  If the list is empty or all expressions evaluate to TRUE, the tariff is applied.  Which variables can be used in eligibility expressions depends on the application environment and context of the tariff as follows:  Application environment of Billing:  All variables with an application environment of Billing or Rating are available, except those with a context of Charge if the tariff's context is not Charge.  If a keyed charge is defined, the key variable name (defined in the Variable Name field on the Charges tab) is available.  Application environment of Rating:  Variables must have the same application environment and if the tariff is:  Global (Global Event? is selected), only variables with the same context are available.  Not global (that is, a product tariff), variables with a context of Service or Normalised Event are available, irrespective of the tariff's context.  Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Eligibility Expression List   Specifies conditions that control the generation (by the RGP) of a rental event for an entity (product, facility group, service, or equipment).  If the list is empty, or all conditions are TRUE, an event is generated.  Otherwise, if any expression in the list is FALSE, an event is not generated.  Depending on the entity the tariff is associated with, expressions can include direct variables from one of the following sets:  Direct variables based on RGP_PRODUCT_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_FAC_GROUP_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V  Direct variables based on RGP_EQUIPMENT_HISTORY_V.  Expressions can also include functions with an application environment of Any, Rating, or Data Entry.  A function with an application environment of Rating or Data Entry can be used within the expression list; however, rather than all direct variables available for the relevant application environment, only the direct variables referenced above are valid.  The eligibility expression lists do not run in a rating application environment, hence they do not have access to standard direct variables, tariffs and derived attributes. Derived attribute variables must not be used in this context. To access derived attribute details in the expression list, use the appropriate functional interface:  DerivedTableLookupByDatex&() for access to global derived attributes.  ServiceTableLookup&() for access to service context derived attributes.  CustomerNodeTableLookup&() or CustomerNodeTableLookup?[]() for access to customer node or customer derived attributes.  For more information about these functions, refer to the Configurer's Reference Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing (Vol. 2).  Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Assignment Expression List  Specifies the expressions that the RGP uses to assign values to the generated event for the entity (product, facility group, service, or equipment).  Fields of the event are assigned values by referring to direct variables based on the  RGP_NORMALISED_EVENT_V view.  For example, the C_PARTY_NAME field is set by assigning a value to the CPartyName$ direct variable.  Depending on the entity the tariff is associated with, expressions can include direct variables from one of the following sets:  Direct variables based on RGP_PRODUCT_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_FAC_GROUP_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V  Direct variables based on RGP_EQUIPMENT_HISTORY_V.  Expressions can also include functions with an application environment of Any, Rating, or Data Entry.  A function with an application environment of Rating or Data Entry can be used within the expression list; however, rather than all direct variables available for the relevant application environment, only the direct variables referenced above are valid.  The assignment expression lists do not run in a rating application environment, hence they do not have access to standard direct variables, tariffs and derived attributes. Derived attribute variables must not be used in this context. To access derived attribute details in the expression list, use the appropriate functional interface:  DerivedTableLookupByDatex&() for access to global derived attributes.

For more information about these functions, refer to the Configurer's Reference Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing (Vol. 2).  Assignment expressions are evaluated only for rental events.  Adjustment events are created by copying the values from the rental event being adjusted.  It is recommended that all data that affects the eligibility of the rating tariff or the content of the generated charge be included in the generated event (by the assignment expressions).  Including this data enables a tariff's eligibility criteria and charge expressions to avoid accessing RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V.  Depending on the cause of the adjustment, rental tariffs that access details in RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V may see the current details, rather than the details that caused the adjustment event to be generated.  Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Adjustment Expression List  Specifies the conditions that control the generation (by the RGP in adjustment mode) of an adjustment event for a previous rental event for an entity (product, facility group, service, or equipment).  If the list is empty, or all conditions are TRUE, an adjustment event is not generated.  Otherwise, if any expression in the list is FALSE, an adjustment event is generated.  Depending on the entity the tariff is associated with, expressions can include direct variables from one of the following sets:  Direct variables based on RGP_PRODUCT_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_FAC_GROUP_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V  Direct variables based on RGP_EQUIPMENT_HISTORY_V.

Before entering an adjustment, ensure that accurate information about the customer is available, amount of the adjustment, and the adjustment type.  The details need to be recorded or verified to successfully enter an adjustment.  When entering an adjustment, it is useful to have the Customer Detail form open for the customer getting the adjustment.  The customer's account number can then be copied from the Customer Detail form and pasted into the Account Number field on the relevant form.  Need more information about adjustments?  Reversing an Adjustment  An adjustment can only be reversed once it is posted to a customer's account.  Therefore, an adjustment made as part of an adjustment batch can only be reversed if that batch is applied.  Adjustments included in an adjustment batch that is not yet applied can simply be removed from the batch.  To reverse an adjustment:  Enter an adjustment of equal (but opposite) value to the adjustment to be reversed.  In the Description field, cross-reference the adjustment number of the reversed adjustment.  Need more information on adjustments?  Deleting an Adjustment  To delete an adjustment not posted to a customer's account:  View the appropriate adjustment.  Click the Delete button on the toolbar.  When prompted, click the Yes button to confirm that the adjustment is to be deleted.  An adjustment posted to a customer's account can also be deleted using the same procedure if:  The adjustment is not included on (appears on) an invoice or statement.  The adjustment has not been posted to the Sales Journal.  Security privileges are available.  If deletion is not possible, the adjustment should be reversed and the adjustment entered against the correct account.  Need more information on adjustments?

The payment is recorded against a specific customer's account and optionally against one or more specified invoices.  Context:  Convergent Billing, Customer Management  See also Payment Batch and Payment Type.  The upper part of the form contains a set of read-only fields in which information about the payment, such as the date it is recorded and its current status, is displayed.  The lower part of the form consists of the following tabs for entering or viewing details about the current payment:  Details  The Details tab is used to specify payment type, payment location, payment amount, date the payment was received, and the account to which the payment is to be posted.  The payment type specified determines the currency in which the payment is recorded and determines whether additional information needs to be entered for the payment using fields on the General tab.  Set the credit account explicitly by entering a value in the Credit Account Number field or implicitly by entering a value in the Invoice Number or Adjustment Number field.  Tab out of the field to implicitly set the Credit Account Name field and, if not set, the Currency field.  A default is set for the Amount field equal to the:  Balance of the account, if the Credit Account Number field is entered but not the Invoice Number field.  Total outstanding amount for the invoice, if the Credit Account Number field was set by specifying the Invoice Number field.  Total outstanding amount for the adjustment, if the Credit Account Number field was set by specifying the Adjustment Number field.  For each of these default values, if the account is a liability account, the sign of the value is reversed before the value is displayed.  The Details tab is also used to enter the name of the person making the payment.  By default, the name of the primary customer contact for the specified customer account is used.  When a payment is recorded, this tab provides access to facilities that allow the payment receipt to be previewed and printed.  General  The fields displayed on the General tab depend on the value set in the Payment Type field on the Details tab.  Fields are often not displayed on this tab when the payment type is set for cash payments.  Default values for the Debit Account Details group may be set, depending on the payment type selected.  If the payment type does not specify a debit account type, the Account Number field cannot be entered; otherwise, it can be edited.  Details should be entered in all fields displayed on this tab.  Allocations  The Allocations tab is used to:  Display invoices or adjustments for the account in the Credit Account Number field on the Details tab.  Allocate payment to one or more of the displayed invoices and adjustments.  The Allocations tab is displayed when all the following conditions are met:  The user's form role includes the View Invoice Allocations access level for the Individual Payment form.  The Credit Account Number field on the Details tab specifies a prime account.  Either the Currency or Amount field on the Details tab contains a value.  A Receivable Type column is displayed only if an invoice on the tab is divided into receivable types or a credit amount is assigned to receivable types.   The tab displays items according to these rules:  An invoice with a zero total amount outstanding is displayed if the invoice has receivable types with non-zero outstanding amounts.    If an invoice is divided into multiple receivable types, each division is displayed on a separate row in the grid with the Receivable Type column.  Otherwise, the invoice is displayed in a single row, with an empty Receivable Type column.    If an invoice has a receivable type, the Total Amount and Amount Due columns display the values for the receivable type.  Otherwise, the invoice values are displayed.    If a credit amount is divided into multiple receivable types, each receivable type is shown on a separate row with empty invoice-related columns empty.  Any credit amount not assigned to a receivable type is not displayed in a row on the tab.  Inserting or Updating a Payment  When inserting or updating a payment, the tab displays:  Invoices  Outstanding invoices, including invoices with an issue date after the value entered in the payment's Date Received field.  Invoices paid as part of this payment.  Adjustments   Outstanding adjustments with a status of Applied.  Adjustments that have been paid as part of this payment.    All outstanding positive invoices or negative adjustments must be paid before any payment amount is left unallocated as credit.   The payment can be allocated in the following ways:  To a single invoice, adjustment, or payment  Split between multiple invoices and adjustments  Credited to a specified account.  A payment amount can be entered against each invoice but the value must be between zero and the value of the Amount Due field inclusive.  The Amount column on the Allocations tab can be edited if the Update Invoice Allocations access level is selected for the Individual Payment form in a user's form role.  Debit Account Allocations  The Debit Account Allocations tab displays invoices or adjustments associated with the debit account on the General tab, and can allocate the payment to them.    The Debit Account Allocations tab is displayed when all the following conditions are met:  The user's form role includes the View Invoice Allocations access level for the Individual Payment form.  The Debit Account Number field on the Details tab specifies a prime account.  The tab operates like the Allocations tab, with the following differences:  The total of the invoice and adjustment allocations and credit amount equals the negative of the payment amount.   All outstanding invoices or adjustments do not have to be paid before any payment amount can be left unallocated as credit.   The Amount column on the Debit Account Allocations tab can be edited if the Update Invoice Allocations access level is selected for the Individual Payment form in a user's form role.  Up-Front Charges  The Up-Front Charges tab lists any up-front charges associated with the specified account, the amount of each up-front charge, and the total of all up-front charges.  New up-front charges can be entered and existing up-front charges can be modified or deleted.  The Up-Front Charges tab is displayed only if a Credit Account Number is specified.  Currency Conversion  The Currency Conversion tab is used to display conversion details of a payment.  The Conversion Date field defaults to the Date Received field on the Details tab and is updated when the Date Received field is modified.  If the Conversion Date field is updated, it is not updated when the Date Received field is modified.  The tab is displayed only if the currency of the payment is different from the currency of the account.  A receipt number is assigned automatically by Convergent Billing when the payment is saved.  The form can be displayed in one of three form modes, with the current mode indicated in the form&#8217;s title.  A form can be displayed in one of the following modes:  Form Mode  Description  View Only mode  Allows information held in Convergent Billing to be viewed, but not updated (modified).

The Individual Payment Detail form is displayed detailing the specified payment.  To search using an account number into which the payment was made:  Select the Accounts @ Accounts History option.  The Account History form is displayed.  Enter the customer's account number in the Account Number field.  Click the Refresh History button.

To view the details of a specific payment, double-click the appropriate payment, or highlight the payment and click the Details... button.  The Individual Payment Detail form is displayed detailing the specified payment.  Need more information on payments?  Entering a Payment  To enter a payment:  Select the Accounts @ Payment @ New Individual Payment option.  The Individual Payment Detail form is displayed in Insert mode.  Enter the payment details on the Details tab.  The payment type selected determines the currency in which the payment is recorded and whether additional information needs to be entered in the fields on the General tab.  The payment type's GL codes are  displayed on the General tab.  The Credit Account Number and Invoice Number fields are used for the account or invoice number to which the payment is being posted.  Enter the account or invoice number and press the Tab key.  The account or invoice number is verified against accounts held in the database and, if valid, the corresponding account name, account number, outstanding invoice number, and amount are displayed.  If invalid, a warning message is displayed in the status bar.  To rectify this, press the Delete key and enter a valid account or invoice number.  If the payment is being made against a specific account (by entering the account number in the Credit Account Number field) the value that is automatically displayed in the Amount field does not include any unapplied payments or adjustments (for example, future-dated payments).  If the payment is being made against a specific invoice (by entering the invoice number in the Invoice Number field) the value that is automatically displayed in the Amount field includes unapplied payments and adjustments.  The date-time in the Date Received field defaults to the current date-time.  The date is overridden by entering the required date either directly or using the drop-down calendar.  The time is overridden by entering the required time; this may need to be done if the payment is entered retrospectively.  If a future date is entered, the payment is not applied until the specified date.  The Paid by group specifies the person who made the payment.  If required, search for and assign a different contact as the payee (use the Search... and Assign buttons located in the Paid by group).  For payments, the Invoice Number field reflects the current status.  The word 'Credit' is displayed if there are no outstanding invoices, 'Split' is displayed if the payment was applied to a number of outstanding invoices or if the payment is allocated to one or more invoices and an amount is left over in credit.  Select the General tab, and complete the appropriate data entry fields.  Select the Invoices tab, and allocate the amount paid to one or more of the listed invoices.  If appropriate, select the Debit Account Invoices tab and enter the appropriate amounts.  If required, select the Up-Front Charges tab and enter the appropriate item and amount.  Click the Save button on the toolbar.  Clicking Save generates a receipt, assigns a receipt number to the payment, saves the payment details, and posts the payment amount to the specified account.  Control is returned to the Individual Payment Detail form.  If required, print the receipt.  Rather than entering a number of payments individually, consider creating a batch for each type of payment and adding payments as they are received to the relevant payment batch.  The payment batch can then be applied at the end of a predefined period (for example, at the end of the day, or at the end of a week).  An organisation's business practices and billing cycles determine whether this is viable, and if so, the frequency at which payment batches need to be applied.  Need more information on payments?  Rejecting a Payment  To reject a payment the appropriate security privileges must be available.  Why Reject a Payment?  Payments may need to be rejected.  For example, a payment must be rejected if the customer's cheque is returned by the bank having been dishonoured because funds are not available in the customer's account, or the cheque is missing a signature.  A credit card transaction also might not be approved because the payment would exceed the customer's credit limit, so the associated payment needs to be rejected.  To resolve these situations so that the transactions in the customer's account history reflect the account status, the payment needs to be rejected.  Rejecting a payment does not remove that transaction from a customer's account history.  It inserts an additional transaction, a debit transaction equal to the amount of the original payment.  Rejecting a payment allows reversal of the effect of posting a payment to a customer's account.  A payment can only be rejected when it has been posted to a customer's account.  Therefore, a payment made as part of a payment batch can only be rejected if that batch is applied.  Payments included in a payment batch that is not yet applied can be removed from the batch.  To reject a payment:  View the appropriate payment.  Click the Reject Payment... button.  The Payment Rejection Details form is displayed.  If rejecting a payment retrospectively, it may be necessary to change the rejection date.  Select a rejection code appropriate to the reason for rejecting the payment.  Unless specifically told to do so, do not change the default values in the Credit GL Code and Debit GL Code fields.  Click the Save button to reject the payment.  Control is returned to the Individual Payment Detail form, where the Payment Status field is now set to 'Rejected'.  Rejected payments are displayed as debits on the Account History form.  The rejected payment is given the same receipt number as the original payment.  Need more information on payments?  Deleting a Payment  To delete a payment not yet posted to a customer's account:  View the appropriate payment.  Click the Delete button on the toolbar.  When prompted, click the Yes button to confirm that the payment is to be deleted.  A payment posted to a customer's account can also be deleted using the same procedure if:  The payment is not included on (appeared on) an invoice or statement.  The payment has not been posted to the sales journal.  Security privileges to do so are available.  Need more information on payments?  Viewing a Payment&#8217;s History of Changes  When working with a payment batch, it is possible to view information about a selected payment's history (for example, that a payment was rejected and later accepted).    To view the history of any changes to a payment:  View the appropriate payment batch.  Select the appropriate payment from the lower part of the form.  Click the Changes… button.

Recording an adjustment as a credit or debit (rather than against a specific invoice) may be necessary if, for example, it is not clear which invoice should be allocated the adjustment.

After the initial allocation is made, view and update the allocations by selecting the Invoices tab (for an individual adjustment) or by selecting an adjustment and clicking the Invoices button (for a batch adjustment).  The amount allocated to each invoice and receivable type is displayed in This Adjustment field (in the Individual Adjustment Detail form for individual adjustments or in the Invoices for Adjustment form for batch adjustments). Any credit amount not allocated to an invoice is displayed in the Credit field. The Credit field is updated as funds are allocated or de-allocated to an invoice or receivable type.  To adjust the initial allocations made to the adjustment (whichever form is displayed):  Enter zero in the This Adjustment field of the invoices not being allocated any funds.  If the whole amount is being allocated against a single invoice, the full amount is entered in the This Adjustment field of the appropriate invoice.  If the amount is being allocated against one or more receivable types, enter the amount in the This Adjustment column for the appropriate receivable type.

If the adjustment is more than the combined total of the outstanding invoice balances, the funds remaining are treated as a credit against the specified account.    The amount in the Credit field is displayed in brackets if amounts are entered with a total of more than the adjustment amount.  View and modify how an adjustment is allocated at any stage.  Press the Tab key or close the Invoices for Adjustment form.  Control is returned to the Adjustment Batch Detail form.

If this is the first move since logging in, the Move Preferences form is displayed automatically.  If not, and the move preferences need to be changed, they can be changed manually.  The following procedure assumes that the move preferences have been set.  To move a customer node:  Display and fully expand the customer hierarchy for the appropriate customer.  Use two instances of the Customer Hierarchy form if necessary.  If moving a customer node within a hierarchy or to a different hierarchy, select the customer node and drag and drop it on to the appropriate customer node.  If moving a customer node out of a hierarchy (that is, a child node is to become a root node), select the child node and drag and drop it onto the hierarchy node.  The Move Confirm form is displayed.    Enter the appropriate date range.  Depending on security settings, the Start Date and End Date fields consist of a single component, the date, or two components, date and time.  Click the Continue button.  The customer node being moved has its start date usually set to the customer hierarchy search date.  If this date is less than the current date and the user does not have historical update privileges, the start date is set to the current date.  The forms displayed throughout the rest of the move are determined by the move preferences previously selected.  The invoice cycle for all customers being moved is adjusted to be the invoice cycle of the new root customer node.  Need more information on hierarchies?  Moving Multiple Customer Nodes  Restrictions on Moving a Customer Node  Move a Customer Node  Multiple customer nodes can be moved only if they are a group of child nodes under the same parent node.  For example, if MegaWork's Melbourne and Sydney offices are both to be moved from the Sales Division and located directly under the head office in the hierarchy, both child nodes can be highlighted and moved simultaneously.  If this is the first move since logging in, the Move Preferences form is displayed automatically.  If not, and the move preferences need to be changed, they can be changed manually.  The following procedure assumes that the move preferences have been set.  To move multiple customer nodes:  Display and fully expand the customer hierarchy for the appropriate customer.  Use two instances of the Customer Hierarchy form if necessary.  If moving child nodes within a hierarchy or to a different hierarchy, select the appropriate nodes from the right-hand panel of the Customer Hierarchy form and drag and drop them onto the appropriate customer node on the left-hand panel of the form.  To select:  A group of customer nodes next to each other, hold down the Shift key, select the first node in the group, then the last node in the group.  All nodes in between the first and the last are automatically highlighted.  Multiple customer nodes not grouped together, hold down the Ctrl key, and then click each relevant node.  If moving customer nodes out of a hierarchy (that is, a group of child nodes are to become root nodes), select the nodes from the right-hand panel of the Customer Hierarchy form and drag and drop them onto the hierarchy node on the left-hand panel of the form.  The Move Confirm form is displayed.  Enter the appropriate date range and click the Continue button.  The forms displayed throughout the rest of the move are determined by the move preferences previously selected.  If one or more of the nodes fail to move, preferences can be set to do either of the following:  Cancel all the moves.  Move the nodes that can be moved and display a report detailing which moves failed, and why.  Need more information on hierarchies?  Moving a Product Instance  If this is the first move since logging in, the Move Preferences form is displayed automatically.  If not, and move preferences need to be changed, they can be changed manually.  The following procedure assumes that move preferences have been set.  When moving product instances between nodes in different customer hierarchies, use multiple instances of the Customer Hierarchy form to display both customer hierarchies simultaneously.  Restrictions on Moving a Product Instance  The following restrictions apply when moving a product instance:  A product cannot be upgraded or moved if the product instance was created as part of a product offer.  A product cannot be moved if its owning customer or target customer is blacklisted at any time during the move period and the user does not have access to view blacklisted customers on the Customer Form.  A product cannot be upgraded or moved if the product instance is cancelled, moved, or upgraded at the effective start date or any later date.   A product must be assigned to a customer node.  A product dragged over a root node or blank space of the hierarchy panel cannot be dropped.   Some information regarding the lists and charge categories may need to be entered (when prompted) before the product instance move can be completed.  If a product instance is moved, any changes made to it before or after the move start date are not carried over in the move.  For example, if the product instance is moved at an effective date before an equipment allocation change, following the move the variation of equipment allocation is not reflected.  A warning is displayed so the user can cancel the move.   To move a product instance:  Display the source node in the left-hand panel of the first instance of the Customer Hierarchy form.  Ensure that the details for the source node are displayed in the right-hand panel.  Select the Products option from the Display for Customer group to ensure that the source product is displayed.  Display the target node in the left-hand panel of the second instance of the Customer Hierarchy form.  Drag and drop the source product instance (located in the right-hand panel of the first instance of the Customer Hierarchy form) onto the target node (displayed in the left-hand panel of the second instance of the Customer Hierarchy form).  Ensure that the product instance and not the associated service is dragged and dropped.  To drag and drop a product instance, click the product instance and, while holding down the left mouse button, move the cursor into the left-hand panel until the target node is highlighted.  Now drop the product instance onto the target node by releasing the mouse button.  As the product instance is dragged from the right-hand to the left-hand panel, the cursor changes from one depicting a stop symbol to one depicting an arrow.  If the icon is dropped when the stop symbol is displayed, no action is taken.  The Move Confirm form is displayed.  Enter the appropriate date range and click the Continue button.

Rejecting a Payment  To reject a payment the appropriate security privileges must be available.  Why Reject a Payment?  Payments may need to be rejected.  For example, a payment must be rejected if the customer's cheque is returned by the bank having been dishonoured because funds are not available in the customer's account, or the cheque is missing a signature.  A credit card transaction also might not be approved because the payment would exceed the customer's credit limit, so the associated payment needs to be rejected.  To resolve these situations so that the transactions in the customer's account history reflect the account status, the payment needs to be rejected.  Rejecting a payment does not remove that transaction from a customer's account history.  It inserts an additional transaction, a debit transaction equal to the amount of the original payment.  Rejecting a payment allows reversal of the effect of posting a payment to a customer's account.  A payment can only be rejected when it has been posted to a customer's account.  Therefore, a payment made as part of a payment batch can only be rejected if that batch is applied.  Payments included in a payment batch that is not yet applied can be removed from the batch.  To reject a payment:  View the appropriate payment.  Click the Reject Payment... button.  The Payment Rejection Details form is displayed.  If rejecting a payment retrospectively, it may be necessary to change the rejection date.  Select a rejection code appropriate to the reason for rejecting the payment.

Need more information on contacts?   Deleting a Contact  Rules for Deleting a Contact  A contact record can be deleted only if:  The record is not assigned as the primary contact for a customer or customer node.  Main or initial contact associated with a customer.  If more than one contact is listed for a specific customer, one of those contacts is specified as the primary contact.  Context:  Convergent Billing, Customer Management  See also Contact and Secondary Contact.  A query is not assigned to that contact.  Any customer enquiry recorded and subsequently processed is referred to as a query.  [[FigureXref:3461-1]] displays the query process.  [[Figure:3461-1]]  Query Process  A query can be recorded against a customer (existing or potential) or, more rarely, against a contact.  Recording a query against a contact is used to accurately record information reported by customers, and for an organisation to obtain statistical information on the types of inquiry being handled and the frequency of each type.  A query must first be recorded (usually by the person who deals directly with the customer making the enquiry) and then either resolved immediately or forwarded electronically to a work group to be resolved.  The act of forwarding the query to a work group is referred to as progressing the query.  If the designated work group cannot resolve the query, or can only provide a partial answer, that work group progresses (forwards) the query to another work group.  Progression continues until the initial query is resolved and a response is made to the customer.  The progression of a query from creation to resolution, using one or more work groups, is referred to as the query workflow.  [[FigureXref:3461-2]] displays the query progression.  [[Figure:3461-2]]  Query Progression  Query workflow ensures that each query is resolved in the fastest possible time and in the most efficient manner, regardless of the query type.  While a query remains unresolved, it is regarded as being open.  Until it is resolved, it is regarded as being closed.  When a query is forwarded to a work group, that work group actually receives a copy of the query and uses the copy as their &#8216;working&#8217; document.  The &#8216;working&#8217; document is referred to as a progression and is used to record any actions taken by the work group and, where possible, the solution to the original query.  Document used to record the actions taken by a work group to resolve a query.  If the query cannot be resolved by the current work group, that work group adds resolution text to the progression before forwarding the query to another work group.    Each progression therefore contains progress text (detailing the actions taken by a previous work group) and resolution text (detailing the actions performed by the current work group to resolve the query).  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Progress, Progress Text, Query Text, and Resolution Text.  To progress a query:  View the appropriate customer query.  Click the Progress button.  A message is displayed, prompting confirmation that the query is to be progressed to the specified work force.  By default, the work force displayed is that associated with the query type selected.  If required, select an alternative work force.  Click Yes to progress the query to the nominated work force.  Need more information on queries?  If the query cannot be resolved by the nominated work group, that work group adds text to the progression (known as resolution text) stating what actions were taken and what progress was made, and forwards a copy of the progression to the next work group.  The resolution text copied from the previous progression becomes the progress text on which the new work group bases its actions.  The process of forwarding a copy of a progression to the next work group continues until a work group can resolve the query.  At this point, a copy of the text stating how the query can be resolved is recorded against the original query and the query is deemed to be closed.  The query workflow mechanism ensures that each progression and the original query are retained and can be viewed.  Text on which a work group bases its actions.  The progress text is created as resolution text by the previous work group before progressing the query to the current work group.  For the initial progression, the progress text is a copy of the query text.  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Progress, Progression, Query Text, and Resolution Text.  Text added to a progression by a work group.  If this work group has not resolved the query, the resolution text becomes the progress text for the next work group.

A contact can be assigned to more than one customer record (as a primary or secondary contact).  Each primary contact assignment must be removed before the specified contact record can be deleted.

The following is an example of when a tariff is changed in the middle of a bill cycle.   Product 1 is effective 01/01/00 to 15/01/02 and contains Tariff 1.  Product 1 is effective 16/01/01 to end of time and contains Tariff 2.  If the product is sold to a customer on 01/01/01 and the bill run is scheduled for 30/01/01, the charges for the bill run are based on Tariff 2.  The bill run picks up the tariff that is effective at the time of the bill run and bases charges for the billing period on that tariff.

Need more information on charge categories?  Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

"},{"id":569,"title":"Tariff Definition Form","url":"60365.htm","text":"The Tariff Definition form is used to enter, view, and update details of a tariff.  The upper part of the form contains basic details about the tariff, such as the name, description, and period for which the tariff is applicable.   Rental (recurring, activation, and cancellation) events are configured using the Recurring, Activation, and Cancellation tabs, which are only displayed when the appropriate class (on the Settings tab) is selected.  The lower part of the form consists of the following tabs for entering and reviewing more specific configuration details:   Settings  The Settings tab is used to:  Define settings for the tariff being configured (for example, class, type, and application environment in which the tariff applies)  Select check boxes (whether this is a global tariff and whether it is billable)  Define the invoice section number and associated text.  Currency to be used for all charges generated by this tariff.  By entering a currency expression, the components of the tariff can be evaluated in different currencies.  The Recurring, Activation, and Cancellation options in the Class group can only be selected for an application environment of Rating.  Click the Eligibility button to display the Expression List form to enter expressions that control the application of the tariff.  Specifies expressions that control the application of the tariff.  If the list is empty or all expressions evaluate to TRUE, the tariff is applied.  Which variables can be used in eligibility expressions depends on the application environment and context of the tariff as follows:  Application environment of Billing:  All variables with an application environment of Billing or Rating are available, except those with a context of Charge if the tariff's context is not Charge.  If a keyed charge is defined, the key variable name (defined in the Variable Name field on the Charges tab) is available.  Application environment of Rating:  Variables must have the same application environment and if the tariff is:  Global (Global Event? is selected), only variables with the same context are available.  Not global (that is, a product tariff), variables with a context of Service or Normalised Event are available, irrespective of the tariff's context.  Conditions  The Conditions tab is used to define the conditions on which the tariff table is searched.  Each condition entered defines a column in the resulting tariff table.  To add an entry (a row of data defining the condition) to the table, click the Insert button and enter details for the condition.  To rearrange the order of the conditions, use the Up and Down buttons.  To view the tariff table, click the Table... button.  Charges  The Charges tab is used to specify the charge and charge expressions to be used to calculate the value of a tariff if the conditions (specified on the Conditions tab) are met.  To add an entry (a row of data defining the charge) to the table, click the Insert button and enter details for the charge.  To rearrange the order of the charges, use the Up and Down buttons.  To view the tariff table, click the Table... button.  Accounting  The Accounting tab is used to specify:  Accounting expressions used to return GL codes and account numbers for the tariff.  Whether the account is included in charges calculated in the rating process for the specified account.  Account check expressions for actions to be taken following rating.  The expression entered in the selected field can be used to dynamically assign the account numbers and GL codes to the costed records they generate.  Any expressions entered override the charge category specified in the Settings tab, and the charge categories specified in the Tariff tab of the Product Definition form for non-global tariffs.  The Real-time Account Aggregation group is used to configure Convergent Billing to maintain a record of unbilled amounts (current amounts outstanding) for an account.  The unbilled amounts are used to provide real-time account balance management for Commerce Engine and real-time tariffs, and are displayed on the Account History form in the Unbilled Amount (or Current Amount) field.  An expression can be specified to check the account balance and perform a specific action if it exceeds a pre-set amount.  The From GL Code and To GL Code fields on the Accounting tab are deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only.  When the GL subsystem is enabled (the GL_ENABLED reference type has a single enabled reference code), the fields are only enabled for billable tariffs.  The GL codes are assigned when a charge is created.  However, the fields do not affect GL guidance or the sales posting process, but can be accessed by the GL guidance function.  The GL codes used during the sales posting and GL upload process are determined using General Ledger Guidance.  The From GL Code and To GL Code fields are enabled if the GL subsystem is enabled.  Recurring  The Recurring tab is displayed only when the Recurring option is selected in the Class group on the Settings tab.  The tab is used to enter parameters used by the RGP to generate an event that recurs on a periodic basis for an entity (equipment, service, facility group, or product instance).  For example, parameters can be defined for a line or appliance rental that is billed quarterly.  A generated event that spans multiple charge periods can optionally be split into multiple events, according to charge periods and a prorate period.  Parameters can be defined to prorate a recurring event by a fixed date.  The charges generated for a recurring event can be defined on the Charges tab of the tariff, or of any tariff that applies to the event.  The tab also provides the option of generating the recurring event for inclusion in an interim invoice (generated by running the Interim Bill Run schedule type), without affecting the regular invoice cycle of the customer.  A recurring event can also be generated for periods where a product has a status other than Active.  The generation of an event is controlled by the following expression lists:  Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Eligibility Expression List   Specifies conditions that control the generation (by the RGP) of a rental event for an entity (product, facility group, service, or equipment).  If the list is empty, or all conditions are TRUE, an event is generated.  Otherwise, if any expression in the list is FALSE, an event is not generated.  Depending on the entity the tariff is associated with, expressions can include direct variables from one of the following sets:  Direct variables based on RGP_PRODUCT_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_FAC_GROUP_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V  Direct variables based on RGP_EQUIPMENT_HISTORY_V.  Expressions can also include functions with an application environment of Any, Rating, or Data Entry.  A function with an application environment of Rating or Data Entry can be used within the expression list; however, rather than all direct variables available for the relevant application environment, only the direct variables referenced above are valid.  The eligibility expression lists do not run in a rating application environment, hence they do not have access to standard direct variables, tariffs and derived attributes. Derived attribute variables must not be used in this context. To access derived attribute details in the expression list, use the appropriate functional interface:  DerivedTableLookupByDatex&() for access to global derived attributes.  ServiceTableLookup&() for access to service context derived attributes.  CustomerNodeTableLookup&() or CustomerNodeTableLookup?[]() for access to customer node or customer derived attributes.  For more information about these functions, refer to the Configurer's Reference Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing (Vol. 2).  Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Assignment Expression List  Specifies the expressions that the RGP uses to assign values to the generated event for the entity (product, facility group, service, or equipment).  Fields of the event are assigned values by referring to direct variables based on the  RGP_NORMALISED_EVENT_V view.  For example, the C_PARTY_NAME field is set by assigning a value to the CPartyName$ direct variable.  Depending on the entity the tariff is associated with, expressions can include direct variables from one of the following sets:  Direct variables based on RGP_PRODUCT_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_FAC_GROUP_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V  Direct variables based on RGP_EQUIPMENT_HISTORY_V.  Expressions can also include functions with an application environment of Any, Rating, or Data Entry.  A function with an application environment of Rating or Data Entry can be used within the expression list; however, rather than all direct variables available for the relevant application environment, only the direct variables referenced above are valid.  The assignment expression lists do not run in a rating application environment, hence they do not have access to standard direct variables, tariffs and derived attributes. Derived attribute variables must not be used in this context. To access derived attribute details in the expression list, use the appropriate functional interface:  DerivedTableLookupByDatex&() for access to global derived attributes.  ServiceTableLookup&() for access to service context derived attributes.  CustomerNodeTableLookup&() or CustomerNodeTableLookup?[]() for access to customer node or customer derived attributes.  For more information about these functions, refer to the Configurer's Reference Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing (Vol. 2).  Assignment expressions are evaluated only for rental events.  Adjustment events are created by copying the values from the rental event being adjusted.  It is recommended that all data that affects the eligibility of the rating tariff or the content of the generated charge be included in the generated event (by the assignment expressions).  Including this data enables a tariff's eligibility criteria and charge expressions to avoid accessing RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V.  Depending on the cause of the adjustment, rental tariffs that access details in RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V may see the current details, rather than the details that caused the adjustment event to be generated.  Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Adjustment Expression List  Specifies the conditions that control the generation (by the RGP in adjustment mode) of an adjustment event for a previous rental event for an entity (product, facility group, service, or equipment).  If the list is empty, or all conditions are TRUE, an adjustment event is not generated.  Otherwise, if any expression in the list is FALSE, an adjustment event is generated.  Depending on the entity the tariff is associated with, expressions can include direct variables from one of the following sets:  Direct variables based on RGP_PRODUCT_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_FAC_GROUP_INSTANCE_V  Direct variables based on RGP_SERVICE_HISTORY_V  Direct variables based on RGP_EQUIPMENT_HISTORY_V.  An expression can include direct variables based on RGP_NORMALISED_EVENT_V.  Expressions can also include functions with an application environment of Any, Rating, or Data Entry.  A function with an application environment of Rating or Data Entry can be used within the expression list; however, rather than all direct variables available for the relevant application environment, only the direct variables referenced above are valid.  The adjustment expression lists do not run in a rating application environment, hence they do not have access to standard direct variables, tariffs and derived attributes. Derived attribute variables must not be used in the context.

ServiceTableLookup&() for access to service context derived attributes.  CustomerNodeTableLookup&() or CustomerNodeTableLookup?[]() for access to customer node or customer derived attributes.  For more information about these functions, refer to the Configurer's Reference Guide for Singleview Convergent Billing (Vol. 2).  Activation  The Activation tab is displayed only when the Activation option is selected in the Class group on the Settings tab.  The tab is used to:  Enter parameters to be used by the RGP to generate a one-off event on activation of an entity (equipment, service, facility group, or product instance).    The charges generated for an activation event can be defined on the Charges tab of the tariff, or of any tariff that applies to the event.  Provide an option to generate the activation event for inclusion in an interim invoice (generated by running the Interim Bill Run schedule type), without affecting the regular invoice cycle of the customer.  The generation of an event is controlled by the following expression lists:  Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Eligibility Expression List   Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Assignment Expression List  Recurring/Activation/Cancellation Event Adjustment Expression List  Cancellation  The Cancellation tab is displayed only when the Cancellation option is selected in the Class group on the Settings tab.  The Cancellation tab is used to enter parameters to be used by the RGP to generate a one-off event on cancellation of an entity (equipment, service, facility group, or product instance).  The charges generated for a cancellation event can be defined on the Charges tab of the tariff, or of any tariff that applies to the event.  The tab also provides the option of generating the cancellation event for inclusion in an interim invoice (generated by running the Interim Bill Run schedule type), without affecting the regular invoice cycle of the customer.

"},{"id":617,"title":"Tips for Searching","url":"1511.htm#o1914","text":"The more specific the search criteria entered, the fewer records returned.  Whenever possible, limit a search to the relevant record.  For example, when searching for a query, progression, payment, invoice, or adjustment, enter the number of the query, progression, receipt, invoice, or adjustment.  Ensure that the record to be retrieved exists on the effective search date.  By default, only records effective on the date that the search is performed are included in the search.  On some search forms, an alternative date can be specified in the Effective Date or Search Date field, on which date records must be effective to be included in the search.  Specifying a date is useful if the search is for records effective at a past date (that is, historical records), or records that were created, but become effective at a future date.  On some search forms, the field can consist of either a single component (date), or two components (date and time).  Granularity (date or date-time) of the field is set when Convergent Billing is installed.  The default value for the field is affected by the granularity, and is described in the associated field help.  Searches are usually case-sensitive.  Searches for customers and contacts (using the Customer Search and Person Search forms) are not case-sensitive.  For example, entering a search string of 'Carol' on either the Customer Search or Person Search form, is equivalent to entering 'carol' or 'CaRoL'.  If unsure of the exact spelling of a person's name, select the Soundex search option (when available).  The Soundex search option (available on the Customer Search and Person Search forms) is useful if the exact spelling of a customer's or person's name is not known.  If this option is selected when the search is performed, any records that sound like the name entered in the search criteria are retrieved.  For example, if the name 'Newtown' is entered in the Family Name search field on the Person Search form, and the Soundex option selected, records for 'Newton', 'Newtown', and 'Newtonne' could be retrieved.  Whenever possible, use the search options available on some search forms to restrict the search to specific records.  For example, the Customer Query Search form can be used to specify that the search should include only active (open) queries, rather than both active and resolved (closed) queries.  If a search fails to retrieve the required record, perform at least one other search using alternative search criteria or the same criteria, but a different search method.  "},{"id":618,"title":"Specify Search Criteria","url":"1511.htm#o1912","text":"Search forms are used to specify one or more criteria on which to base a search.  Only data records that match the specified criteria are retrieved.

If a search that may result in a large number of records being retrieved is performed, a Confirm window asking to confirm that that search should continue is displayed.  To continue with the search, click the Yes button.  If more than 100 records are retrieved, only the first 100 records are displayed.  To cancel the search, click the No or Cancel button and then enter more specific search criteria to narrow down the search.  For example, rather than specifying only the customer type when searching for a customer (which retrieves every customer record having that customer type), specify the customer's name.  "},{"id":619,"title":"Specify a Search Method","url":"1511.htm#o4079","text":"The search method determines how stringent a search is.  The following table lists search methods.  Search Method  Description  Exact Match (default)  By default, only records that match the search string exactly are retrieved.  For example, if the search string 'Carol Bailey' is entered when searching for a customer, only the record that matches it exactly is retrieved.  Records such as 'Karol Bailey' or 'Carol Bayley' are not retrieved.  To perform a less stringent search, use the Wildcard search method.  Wildcard  To make a search less stringent and therefore increase the likelihood of the required record being retrieved, use one or more wildcards.  Convergent Billing supports the following wildcards:  _ (underscore), which substitutes for a single character.  % (percentage), which substitutes for zero or more characters.  Examples.  Single character substitution  Ba_ley  Retrieves any record starting with the character string 'Ba' or 'ba' and the 4th, 5th, and 6th characters being 'ley'.  _arol  Retrieves any record having the character string 'arol' immediately after the first character.  Multiple character substitution  Carol B%  Retrieves any record starting with the character string 'Carol B'.  C%y  Retrieves any record starting with the character string 'C' and ending in 'y'.  %ley  Retrieves any record ending with the character string 'ley'.  Combinations  %rol%  Retrieves any record containing the character string 'rol'.  _rol%  Retrieves any record where the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th characters in a character string are 'rol'.  SQL  The Structured Query Language (SQL) search method is allowed on some search forms.  Conditional criteria can be specified so that only records that match the specified conditions are retrieved.  For example, an SQL search can be used to retrieve only records within a certain range of values.  This method is very powerful and can be complex.

When an adjustment is being recorded, it (or part thereof) can be allocated to one or more of the outstanding invoices or simply recorded as a credit (or debit if it is a negative adjustment).  Recording an adjustment as a credit or debit (rather than against a specific invoice) may be necessary if, for example, it is not clear which invoice should be allocated the adjustment.  When an adjustment is made, Singleview automatically makes an initial allocation of the funds against any outstanding invoices (if there are any).  The initial allocations can be modified before the adjustment is applied.  Adjustments are allocated differently depending on the allocation function specified for the adjustment type.  After the initial allocation is made, view and update the allocations by selecting the Invoices tab (for an individual adjustment) or by selecting an adjustment and clicking the Invoices button (for a batch adjustment).  The amount allocated to each invoice and receivable type is displayed in This Adjustment field (in the Individual Adjustment Detail form for individual adjustments or in the Invoices for Adjustment form for batch adjustments). Any credit amount not allocated to an invoice is displayed in the Credit field. The Credit field is updated as funds are allocated or de-allocated to an invoice or receivable type.  To adjust the initial allocations made to the adjustment (whichever form is displayed):  Enter zero in the This Adjustment field of the invoices not being allocated any funds.

Main or initial contact associated with a customer.  If more than one contact is listed for a specific customer, one of those contacts is specified as the primary contact.  Context:  Convergent Billing, Customer Management  See also Contact and Secondary Contact.  A query is not assigned to that contact.  Any customer enquiry recorded and subsequently processed is referred to as a query.  [[FigureXref:2352-1]] displays the query process.  [[Figure:2352-1]]  Query Process  A query can be recorded against a customer (existing or potential) or, more rarely, against a contact.  Recording a query against a contact is used to accurately record information reported by customers, and for an organisation to obtain statistical information on the types of inquiry being handled and the frequency of each type.  A query must first be recorded (usually by the person who deals directly with the customer making the enquiry) and then either resolved immediately or forwarded electronically to a work group to be resolved.  The act of forwarding the query to a work group is referred to as progressing the query.  If the designated work group cannot resolve the query, or can only provide a partial answer, that work group progresses (forwards) the query to another work group.  Progression continues until the initial query is resolved and a response is made to the customer.  The progression of a query from creation to resolution, using one or more work groups, is referred to as the query workflow.  [[FigureXref:2352-2]] displays the query progression.  [[Figure:2352-2]]  Query Progression  Query workflow ensures that each query is resolved in the fastest possible time and in the most efficient manner, regardless of the query type.  While a query remains unresolved, it is regarded as being open.  Until it is resolved, it is regarded as being closed.  When a query is forwarded to a work group, that work group actually receives a copy of the query and uses the copy as their &#8216;working&#8217; document.  The &#8216;working&#8217; document is referred to as a progression and is used to record any actions taken by the work group and, where possible, the solution to the original query.  Document used to record the actions taken by a work group to resolve a query.  If the query cannot be resolved by the current work group, that work group adds resolution text to the progression before forwarding the query to another work group.    Each progression therefore contains progress text (detailing the actions taken by a previous work group) and resolution text (detailing the actions performed by the current work group to resolve the query).  Context:  Convergent Billing  See also Progress, Progress Text, Query Text, and Resolution Text.  To progress a query:  View the appropriate customer query.  Click the Progress button.  A message is displayed, prompting confirmation that the query is to be progressed to the specified work force.  By default, the work force displayed is that associated with the query type selected.  If required, select an alternative work force.  Click Yes to progress the query to the nominated work force.  Need more information on queries?  If the query cannot be resolved by the nominated work group, that work group adds text to the progression (known as resolution text) stating what actions were taken and what progress was made, and forwards a copy of the progression to the next work group.  The resolution text copied from the previous progression becomes the progress text on which the new work group bases its actions.  The process of forwarding a copy of a progression to the next work group continues until a work group can resolve the query.  At this point, a copy of the text stating how the query can be resolved is recorded against the original query and the query is deemed to be closed.  The query workflow mechanism ensures that each progression and the original query are retained and can be viewed.  Text on which a work group bases its actions.

Recording a payment as a credit (rather than against a specific invoice) may be necessary if, for example, there are no outstanding invoices or it is not obvious which invoice should be allocated the payment.  When a payment is made, Singleview automatically makes an initial allocation of these funds against any outstanding invoices (if there are any).  The initial allocations can be modified before the payment is applied. Payments are allocated differently depending on the allocation function specified for the payment type.  After the initial allocation is made, view and update the allocations by selecting the Invoices tab (for an individual payment) or by selecting a payment and clicking the Invoices button (for a batch payment).  The amount allocated to each invoice and receivable type is displayed in the Amount field in the Individual Payment Detail form (for individual payments) or the This Payment field in the Invoices for Payment form (for batch payments). Any credit amount not allocated to an invoice is displayed in the Credit field. The Credit field is updated as funds are allocated or de-allocated to an invoice or receivable type.  To adjust the initial allocations made to the payment (whichever form is displayed):  Enter zero in the Amount or This Payment fields of the invoices that are not being allocated any funds, before allocating other invoices.  If the whole amount is being allocated against a single invoice, enter the full amount in the Amount or This Payment column of the appropriate invoice.  If the amount is being allocated against one or more receivable types, enter the amount in the Amount or This Payment column for the appropriate receivable type.  To split the payment between two or more invoices, enter the required amount for each invoice in the Amount or This Payment column. If the payment is more than the combined total of the outstanding invoice balances, the funds remaining are treated as a credit against the specified account.

Payments may need to be rejected.  For example, a payment must be rejected if the customer's cheque is returned by the bank having been dishonoured because funds are not available in the customer's account, or the cheque is missing a signature.  A credit card transaction also might not be approved because the payment would exceed the customer's credit limit, so the associated payment needs to be rejected.  To resolve these situations so that the transactions in the customer's account history reflect the account status, the payment needs to be rejected.  Rejecting a payment does not remove that transaction from a customer's account history.  It inserts an additional transaction, a debit transaction equal to the amount of the original payment.  Rejecting a payment allows reversal of the effect of posting a payment to a customer's account.  A payment can only be rejected when it has been posted to a customer's account.  Therefore, a payment made as part of a payment batch can only be rejected if that batch is applied.  Payments included in a payment batch that is not yet applied can be removed from the batch.  To reject a payment:  View the appropriate payment.  Click the Reject Payment... button.  The Payment Rejection Details form is displayed.  If rejecting a payment retrospectively, it may be necessary to change the rejection date.  Select a rejection code appropriate to the reason for rejecting the payment.

Need more information on charge categories?  Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

Click the Save button on the toolbar.  Need more information on charge categories?  Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).

Need more information on charge categories?  Charge Category Examples  A charge category specifies an account type and, optionally, an account, to which a tariff&#8217;s charge or benefit is posted, and is an essential part of tariffing.  Another account type can also be defined and, optionally, an account, to which a balancing (opposite) entry can be posted (known as the &#8216;from&#8217; account).  The term &#8216;tariff/charge category pair&#8217; is often used to emphasise that the two objects are independent, but always go together.  Charge categories cannot reference account types that permit multiple accounts of the same type on a customer node.  The account inferred from an account type assigned to a charge category must be unambiguous.  A charge category instance is created for every tariff used by a service whenever a product containing the service is sold, creating a product instance.  The charge category instance is located at the customer node, the customer (root node), or the service level, depending on the context defined for the associated tariff.  A different instance of the charge category can exist at each level, for use by tariffs with different contexts.  A charge category instance is created using values from the default charge category specified in the appropriate tariff configuration.  The values used can be overridden.  Only one instance of the charge category is created at each location, no matter how many services reference the tariff.  Any defaults for services after the first are ignored.  A charge category instance can be re-defined so that proportions of a charge are posted to more than one account.  They can also be edited after creation, to redirect payments to a different account.  When the rating or billing engine processes an event, the process involves looking up details of the service stored at the customer node, identifying the applicable tariffs, and then using the tariffs to calculate the value of each charge or benefit.  The appropriate charge category instance is then used to identify the account.  The combination of the charge and the account information makes up the charge record in the CHARGE table of the database.  A charge category instance can also define a GL code to assign to the charge or benefit, if required.  However, using charge categories to assign GL codes is deprecated and provided for backward compatibility only. GL codes are assigned to charges using GL guidance (for more information, refer to the Finance Guide for Singleview).
