The Administration Tool allows the performance of Process Engine to be monitored by examining the server's activity.  The reload configuration operation can be initialised from the Administration Tool when the server is in restricted mode.  To access the Administration Tool, an administrative user requires a profile that has the appropriate form role associated with it (see the Security and Auditing Configuration Guide for Singleview).  The tool has the following tabs:  System  Locking  Messages  Users  Reports  Debug Options  Debug Trace.  Options in the System menu also allow:  Separate specification for each tab (except System and Reports) of the frequency with which its details are to be updated (from 30 to 999 seconds).

When logging off users:  An interval between requesting that a user be logged off and the log off occurring can be specified.   A message can be defined that alerts users to an imminent log off.   The log off can be cancelled during the delay period using the Cancel Logout button.  When users are logged off, any open transaction is automatically rolled back (that is, changes to data not yet saved are discarded).  Integration status details are also displayed on the System tab.  The following details are displayed for viewing only:  CB Integration  Always displayed as 'On' because Process Engine is inherently integrated with Convergent Billing.
